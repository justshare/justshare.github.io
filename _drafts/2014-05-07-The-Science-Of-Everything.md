Did you know about [**The Science of Selfies**](http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2014/02/140226-selfie-photography-word-of-the-year-sociology-digital/) or [**The Science of Solitary Confinement**](http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/science-solitary-confinement-180949793/?no-ist)? How about [**Science Says Your Soul is Like a Traffic Jam**](http://www.motherjones.com/environment/2014/03/inquiring-minds-jennifer-ouellette-science-of-self)? Wait, surely, you've heard of [**The Science of Happily Ever After**](http://time.com/72678/the-science-of-happily-ever-after-how-millennials-are-beating-the-odds-to-find-love/)? These articles that offer us what Science has to offer us were all written in the past year.

The ***Science of*** things is the new 'Art of'. 
***

When we as readers were more interested in how to master something, we tended to give a lot of credence to articles that said that they would teach us the 'Art'. Now we want to know the 'why' of everything. 

Enter Science. 

'The Science of' is the seal of credibility that tells us that everything offered for our understanding is backed by research that looked at thoughtfully collected data. 

So, What is the Problem?

Overuse.

The OED defines [science](http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/science?q=science) as:
>The intellectual and practical activity encompassing the systematic study of the structure and behaviour of the physical and natural world through observation and experiment

Unsurprisingly, science is on the OED list of [Top 1000 frequently used words](http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/top1000/english).

We have gotten better at the systematic study of the world around us but we have also gotten addicted to reading about them and of picking catchphrases and soundbites from studies and passing them on.

**Let. us. stop. for. a. second.**

[What is Science? What does it not do?](http://undsci.berkeley.edu/article/0_0_0/whatisscience_12) 

Let us remind ourselves.
