## The Mayans were right. They meant Social Media would end the world.

The Mayans were right all along. If the world were to end, it would be us drowning in a tidal surge of social networking all around. 

###What are the recent social media numbers? 

Social Media adoption is steadily increasing in the last few years and will continue its upward movement for the next several years until it covers such a vast amount of the population that it will become ubiquitous and taken for granted. In 2014, 1.82 billion people across the world will be on one or more social networks. The number will tide [over the 2 billion mark by 2016](http://www.statista.com/statistics/278414/number-of-worldwide-social-network-users/). Mobile access of social media will naturally see an upward trend too and there are already over 4 billion people accessing social media sites using mobile devices.

Once we get past the adoption question, the next one is the usage question:

###How are people likely to use social networks going forward? 

 * There will be a greater insistence on privacy and some movement towards anonymity. We see both happening in the rise of messaging apps like Secret, Whisper, and the early bird to the party, Snapchat. Evan Spiegel [points out](http://blog.snapchat.com/post/74745418745/2014-axs-partner-summit-keynote) that ephemerality of content will become a very important criterion  
 
 * Different ways of sharing thoughtful and valuable longform content will foster community spaces. In the earlier era of blogging the grouping was around people - that you were blogging (about what wasn't so important) at a certain point in its early days was enough to get you into a great network of fellow bloggers. Now it is more about interest based following and sharing of content. Medium is a good example of a clean space with thoughtful content. 
                                                                                                                                                                  
 * There will be many networks for different types of sharing and people are likely to absorb and adapt what they present to each
 
 * [Collaborative Consumption](http://www.amazon.com/Whats-Mine-Yours-Collaborative-Consumption/dp/0061963542) will become more mainstream

### Those with an Active Social Life stand a higher chance of Success.

Research has shown that those with an active social life online are more likely to:

* be open to networking, making new friends and being liked
* likely to find new jobs and opportunities through their networks
* have a higher likelihood of finding dates online via OkCupid and other dating sites
* be more capable of multi-tasking and maintaing a better work life balance

So, what are you doing to stay on top of your social life? Or, are you going the Mayan way?
