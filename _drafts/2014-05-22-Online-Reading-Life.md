###Do ONLY lists

Remember the times when one made lists so that one would remember to do some things? Well, I've come to a point now where I use lists differently. These days I make lists in order that I would ONLY do the things on the list and stop myself right there. The rabbit hole of the web is so tempting that every so often I find myself following trails and gathering interesting nuggets for several hours only to land up with nugget management problems. Not to mention the eye fatigue and the brain numbing. 


###Neuroplasticity

In 2008, **Nicholas Carr wrote a provocative article in The Atlantic: [Is Google Making Us Stupid?](http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2008/07/is-google-making-us-stupid/306868/)**. His argument was not so much anti-Google as it was of questioning if the changing ways of reading and absorbing content was making us less intelligent and perceptive. This article elicited many [varied responses](http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2010/aug/15/internet-brain-neuroscience-debate) - vehement disagreement as well as strong agreement.

>The process of adapting to new intellectual technologies is reflected in the changing metaphors we use to explain ourselves to ourselves. When the mechanical clock arrived, people began thinking of their brains as operating “like clockwork.” Today, in the age of software, we have come to think of them as operating “like computers.” But the changes, neuroscience tells us, go much deeper than metaphor. Thanks to our brain’s plasticity, the adaptation occurs also at a biological level. 
 
  
Carr touched on [neuroplasticity](https://www.stanford.edu/group/hopes/cgi-bin/wordpress/2010/06/neuroplasticity/) which refers to the brain's ability to reorganize or rewire itself. For a long time it was believed that the brain had a fixed number of neurons and that the wiring amongst them became fixed after a certain age. Carr subsequently expanded the content of that piece into a full-length book titled [The Shallows: What the Internet Is Doing To Our Brains](http://www.nicholascarr.com/?page_id=16) which explores the *intellectual and cultural consequences* of the Internet. Carr's article was written six years ago. Imagine the deluge of information that has been added since that time and the many ways of delivering and consuming that information that we have now been exposed to. 


###Pooling ideas from the team
 
 I was talking to my co-workers about this last week and asked them how they read stuff on the web. The conversation was pegged on the following questions: 
 
***
* How do you read? 
* How do you discover new and interesting pieces? 
* How do you mark/file away pieces you like or want to read at length? 
* How do you share what you read? 

***

There were many interesting answers and there were points of puzzlement that we all had over some parts of the reading process which wasn't working for us and which we would love to see improved. Most people used 

***
* some kind of reader: Zite, Flipboard, Feedly, Pulse 
* some kind of read it later service: Pocket, Instapaper, Readability, Evernote 
* some kind of content discovery mechanism: Twitter, Facebook, Email/IM from Friends, Reddit, Pulse/Flipboard catalogues, learning and discovery engines like Zite. 

***

###Zite
I was a big fan of **Zite** and relied on it heavily to do both content discovery and content delivery. As a long time user who steadily helped it along by liking and tweaking my interest pools, Zite helped me along by discovering articles that I enjoyed reading. It was easy on the eye, quick to skim and easy to spend time reading longer pieces too. I integrated it with **Instapaper** for later reading and tied it to **Twitter** and **Facebook** for easy sharing and that was pretty much it. Flipboard's acquisition of Zite is problematic to my reading mind because it brings in the weekend to the weekday. **Flipboard** is my weekend magazine. It pulls in feeds from my **old Google Reader subscriptions** and other wonderful art and photography sources that I like to linger over. The leisurely nature of my flipping is not something I'd like to drag into my morning reading and Flipboard's promised integration of Zite into its discovery system is still not enough to shake off that weekend feeling from my mind. So I am phasing out my reliance on Zite and exploring new ways of reading effectively. 

***
**My aim is to pick a tool or combination of tools that will:** 

* Save me time from unnecessary browsing
* Keep me abreast of happenings in my areas of interest
* Integrate well with other services so that flow of information from discovery to reading to sharing and/or archiving is seamless

***

###New tools
Here are some options that I have been considering: 

* [**News360**](http://news360.com/article/234833756): *An app that learns what you enjoy and finds stories you'll like around the web* looks the most promising and encompassing for my requirements. You can pick your areas of interest by selecting the list of offered topics or allow access to your Facebook, Twitter, Evernote and/or Google + accounts in order that News360 may analyze your streams and narrow it down for you. I let it look at my Twitter account and learnt that I seemed to have tweeted a bit about War because that showed up as an interest along with several expected ones like Technology, Literature, Social Media, Kids, Blogging and so on. Who would have guessed! Like Zite, as you read, you can thumbs up or down articles to help News360 understand your preferences. It offers bookmarking for offline reading as well as integration to popular Read it Later services. Easy sharing to Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn as well as more private sharing via email and messaging are available.

* [**Feedly**](http://feedly.com/index.html): The best thing about Feedly is that you can import your feeds. There are some regulars that you can't miss and carry along from service to service (Hello Bloglines, Google Reader!) and Feedly saves your day by carrying them for you. It has standard features like explore by topic, integrate with social networks like Twitter, Facebook and Google +, cross-platform bookmarking, custom grouping of topics - this is particularly handy if you are researching something and want related articles together for easy studying. 

* [**Pocket**](https://getpocket.com/): A couple of months ago I started using Pocket as my primary Read it Later service. A move from Instapaper which has now taken a backseat in my reading life. Pocket introduced [Preferences](http://getpocket.com/blog/2013/11/introducing-pocket-preferences-discover-better-content-from-your-favorite-apps/) a while ago. Pocket, with its integration to over 500 apps, wants to capture your preferences and share them with the apps that you choose to use so that you automatically get the content you want from any new reading app that supports it. The reading panel in the Pocket app also shows you trending and recommended content based on your preferences.

* [**Klout**](http://klout.com/home): The new discovery element in Klout is useful because once you list out your topics of interest, it brings in related content and also shows you the interest level generated for this content in your twitter network. But content discovery is not Klout's primary use and it merely serves as a motivator for you to keep sharing even when you have not invested time in reading by pulling in some interesting content that you might like and share. 

* [**Pulse**](https://www.pulse.me/): An early favorite in the new days of the first iPad, I used Pulse for a long time until Zite came along. It has a good visual experience unless you are in a hurry and want to quickly scroll through your selected article. Its loading mechanism starts to show its seams then and it can often be frustrating to flick up and then wait. It has a great catalogue and despite the LinkedIn professional spin to its messaging now, it is still valuable as a source to varied and good content across the web.

###Changing equations
So here's my equation to reading online now (perpetually under tweaking, still):

***
**Discover (Twitter / News360 / Pocket / Feedly) + Read it Later (Pocket) + Share (for now in-app) and/or Save (Evernote) = Done**

***
What are the reading tools you use?
