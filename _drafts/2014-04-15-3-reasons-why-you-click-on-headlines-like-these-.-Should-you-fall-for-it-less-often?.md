##3 reasons why you click on headlines like these. Should you fall for it less often?

See how the headline made you click through to this piece? 

Why do lines like ***how to sing in tune in 10 minutes*** or ***n steps for a happy x*** catch our eye and make us want to read more of the piece they headline? Here are some findings:

###1: Research indicates that the brain notices such headlines easily
[Eyetracking research](http://www.webdesignerdepot.com/2013/11/4-essential-ux-rules-taught-by-eye-tracking-research/) suggests that gripping headlines catch the eye of a reader much better than eye-popping pictures. A regular visitor to any website, as pointed out by the piece, [4 essential UX rules taught by eye-tracking research](http://www.webdesignerdepot.com/2013/11/4-essential-ux-rules-taught-by-eye-tracking-research/), is likely to scan content in an [F-shaped pattern](http://www.nngroup.com/articles/f-shaped-pattern-reading-web-content/). Therefore carefully designed sites tend to center their catchy headline and then organize their content to flow along in an F-pattern for maximum conversion.

###2: Headlines that quantify information promise more tangible learning
Why do so many articles list out steps to do things? Why do we as readers have a tendency to click through to those articles? The list type articles are so common that they even have a name: Listicle. 

The New Yorker piece, [A List of Reasons Why Our Brains Love Lists](http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/elements/2013/12/a-list-of-reasons-that-our-brains-love-lists.html) calls the listicle the *Internet-style headline* and goes on to say that its main appeal lies in the way it quantifies the information the reader may venture to consume. However, it points out, lists have been around forever and Martin Luther used them to great effect as early as in the sixteenth century. 

Here are 3 reasons why quantification entices readers:

* ***Numbered listicles offer a good idea of the time required to read the article.***
Since most readers read bites of information in slices of time, the numbered headline makes itself appealing as a quick fix reading that can be completed in a single reading slice. Unless, ofcourse, the headline is *129 steps to a better tomorrow* or *1000 books to read before you die*. Even then, the reader's mind is likely to say, *thanks for pruning it to a manageable 129 or 1000 dear Internet*.

* ***The listicle headline summarizes the essence of the content you are likely to read.***
A headline like **3 reasons to pursue writing daily** quickly announces a few things about the content:
  - Pursuing writing daily is a positive activity
  - Here is why it is so
  - At the end of the article you will be able to state 3 reasons to pursue writing daily

* ***Lists are easier to read than paragraphs and are easier to remember as well.***
When reading a lot of information daily, any article that uses a format that helps retain that information in the reader's mind will definitely find favour with the reader. Which of these articles will you choose in a subway commute: *Top 4 actions you need to take to protect yourself from Heartbleed* OR *How to safeguard your information from Heartbleed* OR *The Heartbleed bug and what you need to learn about it*
 
###3: How often have you seen a listicle calling out 2 reasons?
A quick skim through listicles shows that you need a *3 or >* number on a listicle in order for it to appeal to a reader. In my skimming today, 5 was the most frequently used number that caught my eye. In some parts of the web it looks like 7 might be popular enough a number for [humour websites to take off on](http://7reasons.org/). A site like [Mental Floss](http://mentalfloss.com/lists) loves two digit listicles. They seem to luck out on 11 pretty often (seriously, unbelievable number of 11s on their lists!)

Now that we have established that listicles entice us, let's ask another question: 

###How much is too much?
Speaking for myself, I am reaching the point of zoning out fairly early on articles that use numbers. Their obviousness as a bait makes me feel tricked and therefore tends to lessen what the article they link to has to say to me irrespective of the value of its content. Sometimes they are useful to call out to the essence of an article with precision but when they aren't doing that, I'd rather not use them. Take this piece that you are reading. I'd prefer to call it ***Why listicles are enticing and why you should be judicious about using them*** instead of ***3 reasons why you click on headlines like these. Should you fall for it less often?*** because the 3 reasons are not THE 3 reasons but merely three findings that are interesting to know. The 3 isn't a key and therefore its place in the headline is misleading and suspect.
