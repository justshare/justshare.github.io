##Overview
We [reviewed the free version of Fanpage Karma](http://blog.justshareapp.com/fanpage-karma/) recently and were very impressed. The folks at [Fanpage Karma](http://www.fanpagekarma.com/) were gracious enough to provide us access to their premium version. This is a short Spotlight focusing on the additional features that their premium version brings to the party!

##Functional Highlights
There are a number of additional features and analytics that can be accessed via the [Fanpage Karma premium version](http://www.fanpagekarma.com/Facebook-Social-Media-Marketing-Monitoring). However, **one of the most significant features of this version is that it provides full access to multiple pages or social profiles within a dashboard and multiple dashboards as well**. We need to mention once again that **the search function to fetch these various social profiles works spectacularly well!**

Here is a little faceoff we attempted, now that we can compare multiple social accounts. We looked at three popular golf equipment providers – Callaway, Taylormade and Nike to see how their fan pages were performing. As you can see from the above dashboards Nike wallops the other two in absolute numbers, however its overall performance index is way lower than the others.

We dug into the various analytics sub reports to understand why. One of the indicators that stood out was that while the growth of fans in absolute numbers was far greater for Nike, the comparative daily growth percentages were lower compared to the others. Notice the relatively smaller size of the Nike bubble in the KPI chart.

If you look at the market share analytics, you can easily notice the difference in engagement as well, where Nike was outperformed by the others.

The above types of analyses are really handy and perhaps constitute one of the strongest reasons to upgrade to premium. However, the premium version, as we noted in [our earlier review](http://blog.justshareapp.com/fanpage-karma/) also has many more analytic reports to offer that strengthen its value proposition. We explore some of them below: 

***Times & Types***: This tab allows you to analyze what times and what types of posts worked the best. Really useful information especially if you do a lot of content marketing to figure out the best times and ways to engage with your followers. 

The engagement per daytime report basically gives you a mix of the frequency of posts by times/day versus engagement levels generated.  Clicking on any of the bubbles takes you into the detailed data.

The reports here are interesting and you can already see a couple of things happening here. The times/date where most number of posts were made, did not result in the best levels of  engagement. It was also very interesting to see that links outperformed pictures and videos and possibly usage of more links versus videos/pictures might help drive more engagement. 

Of course, the marketer needs to layer on actual context in these cases before driving any change in strategy, but when analytics can provide counter-intuitive feedback it is very helpful.

***Post History***: These reports are useful to identify those posts with higher engagement to build a pattern around what works best and creates most reactions from fans.

***Post Content***: This is one of the most interesting new feature. Often times we look at optimizing our content strategy for posts and this report can provide some very good feedback towards that. **It provides words and hashtags with frequency as indicated by size and engagement as indicated by color**.  

While we initially found this concept a little difficult to grasp, by the time we hit this tab, it had begun to register and become very useful.  It shows you words and hashtags most used as indicated by size and very importantly most engaging as indicated by color. What a quick visual map once you get used to it!

***Tagging***: This report provides a template to analyze your posts by various criteria. You can add your own tags and classify each post in the post list according to a number of criteria. The post evaluation then provides you with insight against each of these criteria on certain KPIs.
In the evaluation sub tab, you can evaluate based on upto two key indicators from a number of KPIs including; amount of posts, engagement such as likes, shares, comments, etc. You can also evaluate by pages, tags or post types.  The Screenshot option provides you the ability to copy and paste as a screenshot for your presentations.

Tagging is a powerful option, but it requires a ton of elbow grease to harness its power. There is a handy video provided to help you get started as well.

The ability to have fully featured analytics for multiple social media profiles/dashboards along with the additional analytics reports adds a lot of value to the social media marketer.

##Conclusion
We had noted in [our earlier review of the free version](http://blog.justshareapp.com/fanpage-karma/) that its huge limiting factor was the inability to have multiple fully featured social profiles. The Fanpage Karma premium version takes care of this. The **premium version is well priced** as well as we noted in our earlier review. 

The other thing worth reemphasizing is that from its inception **Fanpage Karma has been adding significant value to its offering consistently. A recent evidence of this is their addition of analytics for Instagram!**
