I signed up on Facebook many eons back. For the first few years I rarely used it, until we started going out on trips to various wonderful holiday destinations and met great people. Facebook then became a handy tool to really stay in touch. 

So, I got hooked onto Facebook and now, pretty much have it online all the time.  I look through my news feed atleast a few times a day. With all the stuff also comes some of the fluff.  Now don’t get me wrong, some of the fluff is pretty cool; some of it even gets my lazy a** to occasionally hit the like button or once in a very long while offer the odd comment.  

Over a period of time, with an expanding network of active friends and groups, I got to see a lot more of these posts – and what is amazing is the kind of response some of them get.  A couple of days back, I saw this post about an elderly couple appealing for 5 million likes (I should have clicked a screenshot , but the sequence of thinking it set off made me forget to do so, and I have been hunting for it since!). By the time it reached my newsfeed (courtesy a friend who liked it), it already had 6 million plus likes! 

So that got me wondering if there was a pattern to the success of these, and I started looking for and grabbing some of the more successful posts from my streams (measured by the number of likes they got).  Since none of this is necessarily scientific, it led to this “Unscience” post on successful Facebook posts. 

Without further ado, here are a few of the patterns that I think stood out.

##Weird, Wacky or plain Spectacular!
Posts that are spectacular catch and spread fast.  Here is an example of a spectacular restaurant in a spectacular location that just grabs attention and has garnered over 2 million likes.

But what’s even more interesting is posts that are spectacularly weird or wacky, have a similar impact. 

##Magic
Well, not real magic, but atleast the promise of some magic. Posts with some really good optical illusions for example are catchy. But nothing seems to match those posts that shout out “sucker!” in terms of responses.  Here is one below with over 3 million likes (eyes wide expression!) and over 3 million comments as well (eyes out of socket expression).  Just astounding how many people have hit like and further commented hoping to see some magic.

PS: for the record, the blur effect is not any kind of censorship by justshare and is just part of the actual post’s magic ☺

##Heroes
Posts featuring heroes of current happenings do well. Likely, so do villains too, but generally in the category where fantasy world bleeds into the real world piques our interest.

20K likes for a post featuring the recent Seattle Shooting and Jon Meis, the real-life hero who stopped the shooter, is worth all of it and more. This is probably one of the only categories here that usually has less fluff and is usually worthy. Causes, mentioned later in this post, is arguably another – but often times there are causes that are not necessarily impactful in reality.   

##Celebrity
This is obvious, but posts featuring or promoted by celebrities tend to have an amazing level of responses. Of course, multiple celebrities seems to almost multiply the response as seen in the recent, famous Ellen DeGeneres selfie tweet. Ok, that’s entering twitter territory, but Facebook’s not too different! 

Here is an example featuring two mid level celebrities – India’s Badminton Star Saina Nehwal and Boxing Star Mary Kom. This post had 38K likes in just a few hours. Pretty cool that.

Checkout side by side compares of Nike’s latest World cup football promotion video. The same post by Wayne Rooney versus Bleacher Report UK, over the same time period has such a massive difference in responses (120K verus just 1K!)

Clearly the difference in network size is in effect here, if you can get a celebrity to endorse your post or to feature in it, the effectiveness generally seems to be larger than any other mechanisms available.

##Causes
In general, any kind of social cause works decently well. The definition of causes though does extend beyond just social cause as seen in the case of 6 million liked post described earlier. 

An interesting example below is from India Cricket Captain and Super Celebrity, MS Dhoni’s Facebook page. A side-by-side compare of a regular post versus one featuring the armed services compared over the exact same time period shows an huge difference of almost 4X (400K versus 96K).

##Summary
While many of the above examples are not something we can replicate easily in terms of their scale, unless we are celebrity ourselves or a somehow have a large following – we can optimize our efforts by trying to create content that somehow factors in one or more of the above; Be weird or wacky, Promise some Magic, Celebrate your Heroes, Feature or be Endorsed by a Celebrity or Promote a Cause.
