Messaging has come full circle. 

It is now no longer possible to speak one's mind on Facebook. There are family, friends, coworkers, acquaintances and the rest of the world on Facebook who know your identity and whose disapproval of your frankness is not something you want to negotiate. Even Twitter, which in its early days, gave you enough cover, has now become too mainstream for anonymity. Who you are and what you say are coupled too tightly. The need to not be tied to one's real world identity has become essential to speak one's mind and pursue one's more obscure interests. The days of anonymous messaging are back.

[Edward Snowden's](http://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/apr/14/guardian-washington-post-pulitzer-nsa-revelations) leaks of NSA data surveillance have led to widespread concerns over the security and privacy of an individual's communications. Better encryption and self-destructing messages are becoming important features that users want. 

In the last decade, given the huge advances in tech, we lead increasingly connected yet isolated lives. It is not easy to find good companions in your neighbourhood to do shared activities with. Nor is it easy to strike up conversations with strangers at public events when everyone is buried in their smartphones. Apps that use location to find people nearby for purposeful communication are gaining a lot of traction. 

###So what are the current messaging needs?
 - anonymity (not just with strangers but even within groups of people one knows)
 - ephemerality of content (privacy and security of digital data)
 - access to people nearby (location based communication for specific purposes)
 
###How have new apps responded to these needs?
There are several apps that address one or more of the needs listed above. Chances are you haven't heard of many of them yet each have possibly millions of users and are adding a healthy number of new users everyday. Here are some of them broken down by their predominant positioning

###Anonymous Confessions

[**Whisper's**](http://whisper.sh/) tagline reads *We All Have Secrets. What's Your Secret?*. One of the early movers, launching in late 2012, Whisper lets users post messages anonymously into the vast world of other Whisper users. Each message is posted along with a background image (Whisper offers stock images but users can upload their own). A posted message can be 'hearted', replied to with another similar type of message or with a direct message. Readers of messages may also share the posted message to other networks (Email, iMessage, Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, Pinterest...). Each user is assigned a placeholder (modifiable) name by Whisper and messages are marked by location. Nearby whisperers can be filtered and reached out to privately if required. Identity is still not revealed. Whisper appears to be very popular and claims to get [3.5b pageviews per month](http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2014-03-06/confession-apps-whisper-secret-give-taste-of-online-anonymity)

[**Secret**](http://secret.ly/), a hugely popular successor to Whisper that increases the stakes by bringing in one's contacts into the mix, has become the valley's [confessional](http://www.npr.org/blogs/alltechconsidered/2014/02/19/279671497/the-allure-of-anonymous-confessional-apps-secret-and-whisper
) 

[**Rumr**](http://rumrapp.com/) wants users to communicate with people they know albeit anonymously. Confused? James Jerlecki says Rumr is like talking to people you know with lights off so that you only hear the message but don't see who it is. In [Why Rumr and why now?](https://medium.com/p/cd75269c23e3) he explains his reasoning. Rumr is new and does have the possibility of triggering both confessionals and conflicts given that each person in the room knows who else is part of the room. By a process of deduction and elimination, it should be possible for messages to be pinned to a person and then, voila, take it offline people!


###The Vanishing

[**Burn Note**](https://burnnote.com/) calls itself *Real Private Messaging*. I gave it a spin and it is a very compelling approach. The aim is to be able to send self-destructing messages to people whether they are a part of Burn Note or not. It is more a service than a network in that sense. Users set a timer for their messages to self-destruct and Burn Note carries the message securely to the receiver. Interestingly, Burn Note pioneers a spotlight based reading which reveals the message to the reader piecemeal so that taking a screenshot of the entire message becomes impossible.

[**Wickr**](https://www.mywickr.com/) takes privacy and data destruction very seriously. It uses its patented technology to enable users to send and receive messages securely and to destroy data that has served its purpose. Wickr [plans to monetize](http://techcrunch.com/2014/03/19/want-more-privacy-in-your-app-wickr-now-resells-its-encryption-and-self-destructing-technology/) by selling its Security Suite to other products that want integration of such services

###You Around?
Do you want to take a walk or catch up over coffee? [**Yep!**](http://letsyep.com/en/). Then Yep! meeting request is the way to go. Yep! wants to *Create Instant Meetings with Fun People*. The easy to sign up app (it uses your Facebook credentials) wants users to easily locate activity partners nearby. It is about meeting real people so some information from the Facebook profile is shown in order to establish credibility. Yep! offers unlimited meeting requests free until Jan 1st 2015.

[**Circle**](http://circleapp.com/) is *The Local Network*. It hopes to facilitate event listings, locals news, traffic, alerts and other useful sharing.

###Have It All

[**Banter**](http://banter.me/) wants you to *Chat it Up*. It evokes the good old chat rooms - public and private - and wants users to find interest based conversations to participate in. It uses location to weave in the Nearby category for more local conversations. Launced at the 2014 SXSW, Banter brings in anonymity, location as well as ephemerality (messages live only for [24 hours](http://techcrunch.com/2014/03/06/banter-debuts-an-anonymous-social-network-on-mobile-that-focuses-on-interests-not-confessions/)) to messaging.

###Other Notables

[**Threema**](https://threema.ch/en/), a WhatsApp like Swiss creation, is a paid app that notches up the security quotient by providing end-to-end encryption. It is [seriously secure mobile messaging](https://threema.ch/en/howtouse.html).

[**Drops**](http://www.drops-app.com/) is *Location Triggered Messaging*. You can send friends location based messages which they will receive when they reach the mentioned location. *Pick up milk at the Dairy mart* must be a common request! Perhaps, *don't miss trying donuts at the intersection of 88th and 4*.
