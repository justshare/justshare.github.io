## The Daily Leaderboard

###1. [The Unconventional Wisdom of Ultra-Long-Form Content&nbsp;<i class="icon-link"></i>](http://relevance.com/blog/the-unconventional-wisdom-of-ultra-long-form-content/)
>"Shorter is better, the experts tell us, and they follow that up with both logical and psychological why shorter is better. They inundate us with eye-tracking data, A/B studies and bounce rates. They wax poetic about short attention spans, small smartphone screen sizes and busy lifestyles.  
But then a funny thing happens: Amid the cacophony of gurus, pundits and panjandrums expounding on best practices and industry expectations, someone comes along and does exactly the opposite of what conventional wisdom says they ought to be doing.  
And it’s a big hit."

###2.  [3 Terrible Blog Trends&nbsp;<i class="icon-link"></i>](http://socialmediatoday.com/brennangirdler/2389021/3-terrible-blog-trends)
>"...I’m not going to point any fingers but we’ve all seen these posts before. They are usually lists built around a headline that never, never thoroughly explain anything. Their purpose is simple: To be a placeholder/flag for visitors to stumble on. Blogs need content, so why not write a quick 'this is what I would write if I had the time' post?  
You’ll know these when you see them because of how confused you’ll be once you scroll through them. 'Where’s the info?' you may ask. 'The opening promised me something big, and the content didn’t deliver.'"

###3. [How To Schedule Pins On Pinterest For The Lowest Price On The Market&nbsp;<i class="icon-link"></i>](http://marcguberti.com/2014/04/how-to-schedule-pins-on-pinterest-for-the-lowest-price-on-the-market/)
>"Millions of people on Pinterest have been searching for a way to schedule their pins for free. In the hopes of being able to schedule pins for free, many people clicked on outdated blog posts that either promoted services that are no longer free or services that do not work at all. Just like many of the Pinterest users out there, I was disappointed. However, after doing a lot of research, I have found a way to schedule pins for a low price, and in some cases (like mine), for free."

###4. [8 Brain Triggers Guaranteed To Boost Your Social Media Marketing&nbsp;<i class="icon-link"></i>](http://marketingland.com/8-brain-triggers-guaranteed-boost-social-media-marketing-80269)
>"Knowing how the brain responds to multi-platform messaging is key to unlocking social media marketing success.  
How do we, social media’s guinea pigs, filter through a world’s worth of information, especially when it’s free and available in an instant?"

###5. [How to Provide Social Experiences to your Social Media Audience&nbsp;<i class="icon-link"></i>](http://socialbarrel.com/provide-social-experiences-social-media-audience/55457/)
>"...a consumer’s individual voice matters a lot in social media. In particular, brands should aim to know how what a consumer’s sentiment is towards their company, products or services at any given time. Exchanges between a consumer and the brand through social media are very important, especially when it comes to customer service. This is especially true when that particular customer is an influential one."
