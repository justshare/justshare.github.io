##Overview

ThinkUp's tagline reads **Analytics for Humans**. 

These days, there are plenty of Analytics offerings for social media. Usually they present many different types of data, peppered with many numbers indicating various measures and, as a user, you are supposed to soup all of the offered information up and make sense of them. To be fair, many products offer 'Insights' - which means they tell you what the numbers indicate and what you can do with them (sort of). However, often, as a user, don't you wonder, *What does it all mean?* or *What am I learning about myself and my social world from all of this?*

As you can see, I have juxtaposed two different problems and mixed them up somewhat. One is the existential - making sense of the social world and the other is the material - how can I reach my target audience to gain visibility for my brand and how can I convert them? 

The blurring of professional and personal boundaries in social networking and in the products we use to socialize means that we need many different ways of looking at social data. The value of different ways of looking at social data is becoming more apparent as some new products explore those paths. ThinkUp is one such product.

Here is how they answer the question **What is ThinkUp?**

"***ThinkUp is a smart, simple web app that analyzes your activity on Facebook and Twitter. ThinkUp gives you fun and surprising insights about what you and your friends are doing online***"

#Evolution
With assistance from resources such as [archive.today](archive.today) and [screenshots.com](screenshots.com) we usually piece together the evolution of a product from a few screenshots. Do note this is not necessarily all changes and certainly not 100% reliable. However, it does provide some insights into the product and is generally useful information to have.

The earliest relevant screenshot that we could locate is from October 2013 when ThinkUp's founders - Anil Dash and Gina Trapani - were appealing for funding for the product. 

Anil and Gina are both early bloggers with respective loyal following. When they say on their website that their company is focused on the idea that *people are looking for tech companies they can trust* and that they are putting their *users and community first*, it is pretty natural to trust them given how they have conducted themselves in the social web since its earliest years and how they have given back to the community so far. 


##Navigation and Usability
ThinkUp is super easy to sign up for. Just link to your Twitter and Facebook accounts for a 14-day free trial. ThinkUp will create a page for you with insights for your account and also send you email updates. The page that it creates for you will stay alive as long as your trial lasts.

Once your free trial expires, you need to pick up one of their yearly plans in order to continue using the service. Take a look at [Gina Trapani's ThinkUp page](https://ginatrapani.thinkup.com/) to understand how ThinkUp presents your data.

##Functional Highlights
ThinkUp analyzes the data from your Facebook and Twitter accounts and shares meaningful and fun insights with you about your usage and the people you interact with. The product is still in Beta and it appears to be primarily targeted towards an individual user. However they do indicate a plan called *ThinkUp Executive* for bigger organizations. It wasn't clear to us how that plan might work since we just chose the plain vanilla trial.

**Pricing** appears to be simple - 5 bucks a month or $60 a year to sign up for one account per social network. A second plan is offered at $120 a year for more than one account per social network upto 10 accounts. Other than these two plans, ThinkUp Executive, which seems like a custom offering, is all that seems to be available at this time. 

##Conclusion

ThinkUp's insights are funny and interesting. Over time, it seems obvious that it can provide better and more personally valuable insights. As an individual user, you could signup for one of their plans and see what value it holds for you. If you are an organization, you really need to write to them and find out whether you find a fit. 

For now, ThinkUp seems a departure from social analytics as we have known it so far. It will shape up to something valuable given the creativity, focus and experience of its founders and team. We will be watching.
