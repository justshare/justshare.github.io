###LEANKIT Cards
We at [**JustShareApp**](http://justshareapp.com/) love to use [**LeanKit**](http://leankit.com/) to manage our workflows. So when we started planning content for this blog, we created a board for it. We then went about adding cards to the board and filling in details on each card, marking them as blog posts or tweets or other social tasks. Cards could be assigned to users along with due dates and LeanKit offers a calendar view of all cards that have dates so that status can be quickly viewed. All very well for a high-level idea of who is doing what and when it is due. We supplemented this with more detailed text snippets of posts for each week that we shared with each other on our awesome communication tool [**Slack**](https://slack.com/). *Quick digression: Slack has been so good for our working lives that we hardly ever use email to communicate with the team anymore*.

We did this for a little while and it was fine for the most part except that there was no single place that one could go to for a *detailed bird's eye view* of what was in store for content for a given week and a given month. We haven't planned further than that at this point but I have seen how pro content planners have year long comprehensive calendars for their content. 

So it was time to try something that offered more breadth as well as depth. We started with an Excel spreadsheet and put in the various heads that we wanted to track for content. We wanted it all in a single sheet, quickly viewable. While tooling with the content template it struck me to explore and find out what *content calendar* templates were available on the web. 

***
**PITSTOP**:  
**A word on terminology:** 
I frequently use **content calendar** when I mean **editorial calendar**. So what is the difference?

An **Editorial Calendar** is what you use to plan the content that you create and publish. So if you are looking to create a blog posting calendar where you can plan what topics to research and write about and what media artifacts to assemble then this is the one you want. 

A **Content Calendar** is what you use to plan the content that you are going to share across various networks. So if you are looking to manage social media for one or more clients then you will look to create a tailored content calendar for them where you will want to show what sort of content you will be sharing on a weekly and monthly basis. 

**A word also on sharing of content:**
 Peg Fitzpatrick says that the [general guideline](http://pegfitzpatrick.com/2013/09/30/how-to-get-organized-with-an-editorial-calendar-its-easier-than-you-think/) is "*80% other people’s content and 20% your own. Being a good social friend and sharing other’s content builds your social network. Ultimately, you’d like to be in a position where people are organically finding your content and sharing it because they love it*."

###Editorial Calendar
What I wanted to explore and find out on the web first were editorial calendar templates. I wanted to look at what the experienced practioners were using and to compare them against what we had identified were the heads we wanted to classify and track. 

**Hubspot's** [editorial calendar template](http://offers.hubspot.com/blog-editorial-calendar) was succinct and very useful (via [How to Get Organized with an Editorial Calendar – it’s Easier than you Think!](http://pegfitzpatrick.com/2013/09/30/how-to-get-organized-with-an-editorial-calendar-its-easier-than-you-think/)). I found the Call-to-Action marked against each post particularly insightful.

**Content Marketing Institute** also has a pretty [good editorial template that they've shared](http://contentmarketinginstitute.com/2010/08/content-marketing-editorial-calendar/). This template has columns to track different content types that could be scheduled and created on a given day.

Pam Moore shares the [editorial template](http://www.pammarketingnut.com/about/resources/content-marketing-editorial-calendar-template/) that her team uses at **Marketing Nutz**. In her comprehensive piece [Content Marketing Editorial Calendar Template 2014](http://socialmediatoday.com/pammoore/2040771/content-marketing-editorial-calendar-template-2014), she offers many valuable inputs on Content Marketing Requirements in 2014. She says
>"Content marketing is at the core of every business of every size. Big, small, smart, not so smart, agile, slow and every thing in between.  Regardless of your industry, niche, age of company or primary communication medium used, you better have a content marketing strategy to connect you and your brand with your target audience, customers, partners and stakeholders. 
Social media status updates, images posted to Instgram, blog posts, websites, podcasts, videos, YouTube Hangouts, Twitter chats, in person meetups and network events all center around conversation and engagement. At the core of any conversation is content."

After considering these three templates, here is what can be culled from them:

***
**Primary Elements/Columns in an Editorial Calendar for a month**

* Day of the Week grouped by Week
* Topic or Title of Post 
* Details related to Post
* Keywords
* Author
* Editor
* Due Date
* Publish Date
* Target audience (could be broken into primary, secondary, tertiary based on need)
* CTA (A Call-to-Action directs your target towards an action that will facilitate engagement and conversion)

***

We have now tailored our editorial calendar with the elements I've highlighted above. For our present monthly planning we use an Excel spreadsheet with these elements to get an easy yet informative view of what the content creation and publishing plan for the month is. 


###Content Calendar
A content calendar is used to plan sharing of content across social networks. It is similar enough to an editorial calendar that some of you might be tempted to bunch them together into a single calendar. If that works for you, great. But it might be too much of a good thing, overwhelmingly detailed. 

 So let's look at what goes into a content calendar:
 
 ***
 **Primary Elements/Columns in a Content Calendar for a month**
 
* Day of the Week grouped by Week
* Theme of the Week
* Theme of the Day
* Content to Post
* Keywords
* Networks to Share to
* Time of Day to Post
* Target audience (could be broken into primary, secondary, tertiary based on need)
* CTA (A Call-to-Action directs your target towards an action that will facilitate engagement and conversion)

 **Solo PR Pro** has some [great calendar templates](http://soloprpro.com/the-best-content-and-social-media-calendar-templates/) to *manage content and conversations around it*. You might find one or more to use as a starting point to create your own.

###RIPENN
Some of you might be explorers of new tools. You are always up for trying what is new in the market and seeing if it might add value to your business or personal needs. [**Ripenn**](http://www.ripenn.com/product/) is one such tool. It is still in *private beta* but you can sign up to give it a spin. Ripenn has this beautiful metaphor of seeding ideas and letting them ripen. Every new idea is a "seed" in the "Greenhouse". Once the idea evolves, it can become a "bloom" which can be assigned and set a deadline for.

I am still exploring how we might purpose Ripenn for our content needs at [JustShare](justshareapp.com). The tool looks promising so far. Good work Ripenn guys!
