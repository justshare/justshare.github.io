Engagement is a voluntary process involving investment of time and attention in someone or something that interests us.

### Rules of Engagement

As a startup or small business interested in increasing your visibility and growing your customer base, you need to pay attention to Social Media Engagement. 

For most of us, in social settings offline, there are established rules of engagement that we automatically follow. In an online setting, where we are the voices behind our brands, we need to follow similar rules of engagement to grow our trustworthiness and to genuinely add value to the people we interact with.

What are some of the **rules of online engagement**?

###Social Presence
There are many networks with millions of users out there. Each has its own communities and appeal. As a business looking to make yourself visible, you must start looking at these networks slightly differently that you would as a casual user. 
 
 
**Twitter** is a great mixer where it is useful to be around and be consistent. Over a period of time, as long as you are sincere and mean to connect for mutual value, people tend to interact and help amplify your presence. Twitter would win hands down as the network for which the maximum number of tools are available. Many of these tools will help automate some of your monitoring and interacting needs. Use a good tweet scheduler to stock up on tweets, post and share good content often, share thoughts and comments. You can use some [great free tools](http://blog.justshareapp.com/5-Great-Free-Tools-For-Social-Listening/) to listen to and analyze your network.  


**Facebook** has the greatest number of people in its network and keeps changing its rules about how they can be reached. Interacting here may not be as simple as @mention on Twitter. However if you set up your Facebook page to post useful content, pay attention to the [visual appeal of your content](http://www.socialmediaexaminer.com/encourage-fans-to-create-share-visual-content/), encourage [creative ways of getting your fans to participate](http://www.socialmediaexaminer.com/encourage-fans-to-create-share-visual-content/) and [study effective ways of using Ads](http://blog.kissmetrics.com/deep-dive-facebook-advertising/), you will start to see some traction.  


**Google+** is *great for SEO*. You will keep hearing this often. Since Google indexes and serves most of what people look for, it makes sense to establish your presence in its network. One thing you will notice is the nature of the content shared. While visuals do add appeal, a lot of people tend to write longform content and share other interesting content with their own comments and insights appended. It is a place to learn how to do things.  


**LinkedIn** seems to work well for B2B segments. It is [rated very effective - 62%](http://contentmarketinginstitute.com/2013/10/2014-b2b-content-marketing-research/) for business to business marketing. Companies looking to share insightful and authoritative content to other businesses will do well to explore [LinkedIn publishing](http://help.linkedin.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/47445/~/linkedin%E2%80%99s-publishing-platform---overview) which has now been opened up to regular members. 


Spend some time exploring other networks to understand what value proposition they may hold for you. Remember that **purposing online networks is still at an early stage** and you may be able to create engagement and build good customer relationships through experimenting.  


Do not ignore the [business value](http://www.socialmediaexaminer.com/new-research-shows-social-networks-ideal-marketers/) that visual mediums like **Pinterest**, **Instagram** and **Tumblr** can create.  


Do not ignore what video can do to engage people. **YouTube**, **Vimeo**, **Vine** are all worth exploring. 


Do explore **Quora** not just to ask questions but to also share content that might appeal to a very interactive and engaged set of people.  


Caveat: Start small. Remember there is only so much time. So pick networks that might work best for you and expand as necessary.

* **Track**: Pitstops to check your notifications and mentions
* **Respond**: Factor in time at various points in the day to reply to queries and comments
* **Create/Share**: A good candidate for automation. Spend one or two blocks of time to stock up on what you want to share and then let your tools do their magic
* **Make Notes**: Spending a few minutes monitoring analytics data and jotting down observations from daily engagement can be valuable, over a period, in understanding what works and what needs tweaking.
