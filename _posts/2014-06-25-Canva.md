Following up on our [Product Spotlight - Social Media Management with Over-Graph]( http://blog.justshareapp.com/Over-Graph/), we look at another exciting product  - **Canva**.

Canva brings together a bunch of elements from formats to **fonts** to **images** to **layouts** to **photo editing** to **collaboration**, to provide a comprehensive design capability for a variety of **web and print needs**. Whether you want to design a facebook post Or an amazing brochure – Canva has it all put together for you.

Canva claims to be “fun, free and simple to use”. We decided to put this claim to test in our Product Spotlight for this week.

##Evolution
With assistance from resources such as [archive.today](http://archive.today) and [screenshots.com](http://www.screenshots.com) we usually piece together the evolution from a few screenshots. Do note this is not necessarily all changes and certainly not a 100% reliable. However, it does provide some insight into the product and is generally useful information to have.

With Canva, what we could observe was from early stage alpha website in 2012, it evolved in April 2013. The messaging focus was a design collaboration, but by September 2013 the focus almost entirely was simplified to Ease of design (although they still support collaboration to date). By Jan 2014 a significant change was the login process – earlier it appears to have assigned a URL based on your username to just login via FB (or email/username). Likely there is still a URL for each user, but the process was made more frictionless.  Probably this aligned well with the focus on collaboration to focus on ease – just a guess, but it was certainly easy to use when we tried it!
 
The latest evolution has a real cool, simple and fun feel to it.

##Navigation and Usability
The initial experience and feel, starting from the time you land on the website is a very simple yet very cool experience.  Logging in with your Facebook account takes you directly to the design board. This first time experience sets the tone for Canva. There is a superb 23 second guide that uses animation on the live site to guide you through the various steps.

This is then followed by a Starter challenge that has various canvas laid out with instructions for certain actions, such as entering in some text or adding an image to a design.

The starter tutorials are a great experience, but Canva is so well laid out and simple, for the power users in us, it is very easy to even just get started right away. The home screen allows you to pick a format for your design, review existing designs, use some editor selected designs and also offers tons of design tutorials.

The design screen is laid out simply but effectively with the design as the center piece, design elements including a very good search bar on the left side and menu items to share/save/navigate on the top.

Certainly, navigation and usability wise, Canva’s theme of fun, free and simple to use, bears out very well.

##Functional Highlights
As soon as you are done with the Starter challenge, Canva takes you to the home screen, with a nice overlay on the elements of that screen. Another example of its easy to use nature.

You can start by picking up a design template, here is one area where Canva excels – it has a variety of formats as you can see below so you do not need to worry about the size of the design item and can focus on design. It also allows you to pick a custom size if you have one that is different from the many options pre-defined by Canva!

Once you have picked a design canvas, you are taken to the design page.  You can start by selecting a layout or even a background. I found a number of interesting layouts and decided to start with a layout and then work my from there. 

Once you have your design in mind, you can add Text, Images and even upload your own photo. There are a number of little things along the way that help you create a good design; You can select color, font, weight, position etc for text very easily. You can search for images and locate and include images very easily. There are over a million images available and pretty much you can locate an image for any need. The only caveat here is many of the images are not free and are typically $1.

Should you decide not to use their images and it is proving costly, then you can even upload and use your own images. There is even a neat filter to process your uploaded image. You can also choose to pull images from your logged in facebook account which is really useful.

Finally, you can save, publish or share your design. You can also select an option to share your design for collaboration and send the link to your collaborators to edit/modify/update the design.

So it all sounds great doesn’t it? And for the major part it is! There were a couple of small niggles, depending on how you see it.  For one, it appeared that the more images you search for, after a few such searches the image saving would get stalled and you would be asked to reload. Yet, the error handling was handled elegantly enough that it added to the experience! See image below. 

<br/>

Another bothersome thing I noticed was that manipulating images on the design would sometimes result in unexpected behavior. For example, when I tried to position an image within a design, the image ended up taking the entire size of the canvas (it became the background image). A reload sorted it out, but having to reload each time I moved a image would not work out.  Having said that, this was not reported by fellow justshareapp colleague Arvi, who loves using Canva for some of his graphic designs. Since I use a lowly Macbook Air compared to his Macbook Pro, I wonder if limitations in computing power could cause some lag when manipulating designs.

##Conclusion
As a design tool, Canva certainly lives up to its claim of being - “fun, free and simple to use”, to a very large extent.

While in general it is snappy to use, there seemed to be a couple of performance related niggles in my Macbook Air. In addition, I haven’t done the math yet, but it does seem having to pay $1 per paid image could add up quite seriously for designs with lots of elements. 

Having said that, the positives far outweigh the niggles above. It is fairly complete as far as designing features are concerned and you should be able to create some great designs. The ability to select the target for which you are designing for (eg. Facebook Cover) makes it really friendly to start with. Along with the design tutorials, images available, and other elements that you can manipulate, it is quite extensive while still being easy to use.

**All in all, if you frequently create designs for your blogs, social media or even for print – you should check out Canva!**

On a side note, Canva has a kickass blog as well – and every now and again we find something interesting to feature in our [Daily Best from Social Media Mavens]( http://blog.justshareapp.com/daily-best-social-media-maven-posts/)
