Interested in Social Media management and monitoring? There are many popular tools out there – Hootsuite and SproutSocial being a couple of the leading ones. This review focuses on an interesting new tool with a different approach from another upcoming startup – [12Mass](http://12mass.com/).

12Mass claims to help you “Scale up conversations on Twitter and Facebook using dialog decision trees and A/B testing”. Their website talked about a more scientific approach to social media monitoring and analytics, and we thought it would be really interesting to review them.

What 12Mass does is to help you identify relevant conversations and then test various responses against them. Very similar, they claim, to A/B testing often used when gauging responses to product features, but equally useful with Social Media. 

We take a look at all of this in more detail in this week’s Product Spotlight.

##Evolution
With assistance from resources such as [archive.today](http://archive.today) and [screenshots.com](http://www.screenshots.com), we usually piece together the evolution from a few screenshots. Do note this is not necessarily all changes and certainly not a 100% reliable. However, it does provide some insight into the product and is generally useful information to have.

Since 12Mass is fairly recent we could not trace back as many versions as we usually do with other products. They seem to have started sometime in 2013 with invitations for a beta (as listed in betalist.com) and have moved into a generally available status sometime this year. The messaging has remained consistent since the early invite launch.

*Disclaimer: The above is gathered from reviewing web archives. The timelines, changes and the reasons for change may be inaccurate and are only our attempt to guess the evolution of the product.*

##Navigation and Usability
You can get started by logging in with your twitter account. Once you have logged in you are prompted to provide your email ID and then taken to the dashboard.

<br/>

On the dashboard is one of the most comprehensive quick start guides you will find. As you review each step as represented by the product screenshots, you can also click on any element within the guide to get further details on what that element is and how you can use it. At the end of the quick start guide there is even a video to assist you further in getting started.

The dashboard can be built with one or more tabs, each tab allows you to manage one or more posts/tweets searches. By default there is one tab for you to get started with, and you can add more as and when you need them.

The interface looks good, but can take some time to figure out, unless you have paid very close attention to the start guide or the video. At certain times it also feels a bit sluggish especially as you browse through the various search options.

Overall 12Mass can be hard to start using and there are some inconsistencies in behavior described later that do not help either. However, once you "get in" and are a power user, you might start to enjoy using it!

##Functional Highlights
Once on the dashboard you can start configuring your tab with various saved searches for tweets, posts and people. The first option, if you have signed in via Twitter, allows you to configure your tab stream with Tweets that @mention your Twitter handle. You can then further refine it using keyword or phrase searches. 

A really nice touch here and in other search options as well, is a default tag cloud with common keywords from tweets/posts, that helps you easily identify what keywords are commonly used.  Once you select a keyword, the preview tab shows all relevant tweets. You can save one or more searches for retrieval later.

Another way to bring important conversations to the forefront is to search across all Tweets (across Twitter) for relevant keywords or phrases that you can monitor and respond to appropriately. The Tweet Search option allows you to search and save searches for this option.

If you have logged in via Facebook you will be able to do the equivalent of the above by creating and monitoring saved searches for posts and comments for pages that you own.

You can also search for People using keywords or phrases to view and respond to specific people of interest in Twitter.

You can edit and name all your saved searches and you should be able to access them in a click the next time. We found some issues with saved searches not showing up correctly the next time around occasionally, and some inconsistent behavior around this. But overall it was manageable.

These options allow you to configure and setup monitoring various relevant conversations. The search function and the tag clouds work quite well and are really useful. However, the main promise with 12Mass is their ability to help you analyze, create and publish great responses. 

You can respond by retweeting, favoriting or replying to a tweet. You can also queue up responses. The queued up responses for each search can be viewed under the Queued option in the tab. The settings for queuing are available in the settings against each account. You can setup the Queue interval to be spread over several hours Or to be sent every X minutes. You can also configure your bit.ly account for link shortening.

**The killer feature for 12Mass lies in here. You can save your responses and view reactions and other key metrics against various responses. As 12Mass projects, this feature serves as a handy A/B testing tool for social media posts.** We weren't able to generate enough live data in the time we did our review, but you can see the potential from the screenshot below.

In addition to the above, you can also schedule posts or tweets at custom times. The other feature that can help with general engagement and keeping a healthy, active social media account – is the ability to configure and auto-queue posts via RSS feeds. This feature was a little puzzling since 12Mass claims to be against automation in the homepage. It is a handy feature to have though.

Once you have played around with and setup the above with one Tab and one Account you can add even more power to your Dashboard. 12Mass allows you to add more Twitter or Facebook accounts and you can configure and work with multiple social media accounts. 

Further, you can also add multiple tabs for tweets/posts via the above saved search options to monitor simultaneously. Each tab allows you to view all, pending , sent, queued, favorited tweets meeting the saved search criteria. You can also do further keyword searches within each tab to refine the search results and the ever present tag cloud is available to help as well!

Note: 12Mass' website also talks about dialog decision trees. We were unable to review this feature, but it sounds very promising and build on the response management.

On top of the dashboard you can see the number of Sent posts, Queued posts and credits left. Each sent post represents a credit and as it appears currently users have 500 free credits beyond which they will need to apply for a paid account. Pricing is available on request.

##Conclusion
12Mass’ value proposition and approach to Social Media management and monitoring is certainly intriguing. Especially with their scientific approach to response management and A/B testing analysis. 

There is scope for improvement on the usability of the product, but its fairly unique approach carries into the interface. Social Media Marketers who want to leverage Twitter or Facebook for generating leads should give 12Mass a try.
