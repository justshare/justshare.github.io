## The Daily Leaderboard

###1. [The Return of Podcasting: 4 Platforms That Will Help You Build an Audience&nbsp;<i class="icon-link"></i>](http://contently.com/strategist/2014/06/05/the-return-of-podcasting-4-platforms-that-will-help-you-build-an-audience/)
>"Studies show that audiences of people who listen to podcasts on their cell phone in their car grew 10 percent from 2010 to 2012, and nearly one in five U.S. adults listens to podcasts at least occasionally. But the podcasting scene isn’t just for comedians trying to get their jokes off their ground. This emerging arena presents an opportunity for brand publishers to reach audiences through media that aren’t as crowded as social media and video—and on platforms that aren’t already saturated with brand messages."

###2.  [How to succeed in the ego-ravaged drama queen world of social media&nbsp;<i class="icon-link"></i>](http://www.businessesgrow.com/2014/06/09/social-media-ego/)
>"So let’s get this out on the table. Trying to make a name for yourself in this social media world can hurt. 
The angst of wanting to be heard felt familiar again last week when I posted the list of 70 Rising Social Media Stars. It was a strong post, a nice way to shine a light on a few worthy people. I’m proud of it and it made me feel good to see the authentic emotions that came from the great folks being recognized. One fella tweeted “Look ma! I’m on a list!” 
But it also hurt to see people disappointed they were not on this list. "

###3. [Stop Killing Us With Boring Infographics – Do This Instead&nbsp;<i class="icon-link"></i>](http://sociallysorted.com.au/boring-infographics-do-this-instead/)
>"Are you creating or thinking about creating infographics?  Got your data ready and thinking about how to turn it into “data visualization” with pretty pie charts turned into globes or cityscapes, shopping baskets or mountains? 
I want you to stop. Read this post. Then add something to your (potentially) boring infographics. Until you add this one thing, you really are missing out on valuable traffic, shares and all round love for your infographic."

###4. [5 Ways Startup Tech Companies can Reach Online Influencers&nbsp;<i class="icon-link"></i>](http://www.buildbrandblast.com/5-ways-startup-tech-companies-can-reach-online-influencers/)
>"Online influencers, those with large social followings or readerships, are some of your best resources as a startup tech entrepreneur. Not only are they usually able to give you guidance, they can also serve as syndication platforms to extend your reach and expand your audience. 
Reaching out to an online influencer can be intimidating, especially when your rapport or familiarity are limited. But it’s something you’ll need to do if you’re interested in rapidly improving your social reach or gathering potential investors."

###5. [The 3-Step Journey of a Remarkable Piece of Content&nbsp;<i class="icon-link"></i>](http://www.copyblogger.com/remarkable-content/)
>"You know it when you’ve read it. 
It’s that blog post, article, video, or speech that changes you. 
It touches you. You are so affected by its message you can’t help but share it. 
We’ve all experienced content like this. But do we know how to create it? That’s the question. Because consistently creating remarkable content over time is what it’s all about. 
You’re aiming to create content that makes people pay attention, think, and feel."
