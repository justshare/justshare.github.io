But how do you gain those trust signals that Google Authorship provides? How do you improve your authorship reputation, rise in the ranks, and gain more readers.
Thankfully, it’s possible. I know, because I’ve been able to do so myself. In this article, I’ll explain exactly how it’s done.

>...we humans pass down wisdom learned from our elders, even when some of that “wisdom” stops being wise quite some time ago. And if there’s one thing I’m convinced of from studying the Social Age for five years now, it’s that this era will feature and embrace the self-employed. As this new age continues to unfold, you’re going to have to try very hard not to be your own boss.
