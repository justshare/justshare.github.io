## The Daily Leaderboard

###1.  [Why Your Quest for the Perfect Product Will Guarantee Failure&nbsp;<i class="icon-link"></i>](http://www.inc.com/chris-heivly/why-the-perfect-.html)
>"Slow down: Before you have 1,000 customers, figure out how to land customer No. 1.
...
In our hearts and minds, most of us love building things. We also tend to envision with perfect clarity the hundreds, thousands or millions of satisfied customers consuming the fruits of our labor.
...
Herein lies the product fallacy that all too often plagues startup entrepreneurs: If you build it, they may not come."

###2. [Google URL Builder: How to Track Links Shared&nbsp;<i class="icon-link"></i>](http://www.razorsocial.com/google-url-builder/)
>"How do you track how many people click on links you share out on social channels such as Facebook, Twitter or LinkedIn? 
What happens when you share the same link out on e-mail?  Are you tracking which link got the best results? 
When you look at Google analytics you can see the different channels that generated the traffic (e.g. Facebook, Twitter etc) but you can’t drill it down to specific links shared. 
At times you want to really figure out what traffic is generated and where it comes from. 
The Google URL builder was developed to support this problem."

###3. [Social Media Best Practices in Travel: Pinterest&nbsp;<i class="icon-link"></i>](http://socialmediatoday.com/gonzogonzo/2413466/social-media-best-practices-travel-pinterest)
>"Setting up compelling and inspirational boards is the first and most important step in staking a winning presence on Pinterest. A great example comes from hospitality leader Four Seasons Hotels, which launched their Pin.Pack.Go initiative in 2013.
...
Whichever destination you choose, if there is a Four Seasons property in that area, it will help planning your stay with suggestions of things to see and do, places to eat, and even places to stay – because you may not stay at a Four Seasons for all of the stay, or any of it for that matter, but herein lies the true spirit of collaborative boards after all, right?"
