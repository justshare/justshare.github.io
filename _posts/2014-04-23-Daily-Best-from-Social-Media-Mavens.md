###2.  [What the Good Judgment Project Can Teach Marketers About Product Recommendations&nbsp;<i class="icon-link"></i>](http://www.marketingprofs.com/opinions/2014/25238/what-the-good-judgment-project-can-teach-marketers-about-product-recommendations)
>"When shoppers visit a retailer's website, there is a good chance they will be presented with specific product recommendations as they surf around from page to page. "People Who Like That Product Also Like These Products" and "We Think You'll Love These Items" are common website merchandising blocks we have all seen on most stores' sites. And, for the most part, the same assertion that the three psychologists in The Good Judgment Project made—that large groups of people can predict something better than a few people can, no matter how much or how little information they have—is used every time a shopper visits a retailer's website."

>"Sure, there are industry standards like PayPal and Square, but small business owners have a lot of digital payment options when it comes to accepting payments from your customers and clients.
Many of the options we found go way beyond being able to accept credit cards at affordable rates with little up-front cost. And each company’s offering varies from the others. 
When deciding which digital payment options your company will adopt, consider what your needs are and then pick the service that suits those needs."

###5. [50+ Things You Should Learn About Your Client&nbsp;<i class="icon-link"></i>](http://moz.com/blog/50-things-you-should-learn-about-your-client/)
