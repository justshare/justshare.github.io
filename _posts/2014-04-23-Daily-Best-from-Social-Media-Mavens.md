## The Daily Leaderboard

###1. [Deeplinking -- And 4 Ways To Fix App Discovery&nbsp;<i class="icon-link"></i>](url)
>"I’ve been spending a lot of time over the past couple of months thinking through why there’s no great way to discover mobile applications in 2014. There’s been a number of posts on the topic, including why we’re still in the pre-pagerank phase of mobile. Facebook also brought the issue more into the spotlight with AppLinks yesterday. The problem I see is that we’re trying to correlate something from the desktop world — web search — to the mobile world — app discovery. It’s a wildly different problem and here’s why: ..."

###2.  [How Jabong is accelerating innovation to arrive at great last mile customer experience&nbsp;<i class="icon-link"></i>](http://yourstory.com/2014/05/jabong-innovation/)
>"E-commerce in India has lately been buzzing. The biggies of the field are constantly ideating and innovating to win the race or simply to stay ahead.
...
So, it is no surprise to see how quickly Jabong reacted to a random tweet that talked about over-sized, heavy bags carried by the delivery staff of Indian e-commerce companies.
...
What came out of these tweet exchanges is a design hackathon to “disrupt this very courier bag and emerge with something more efficient, user friendly – eventually making even the last leg of the customer experience better for the vendor and customer.” "

###3. [The Effects of Content Shock&nbsp;<i class="icon-link"></i>](http://www.business2community.com/infographics/effects-content-shock-infographic-0875841)
>"Content shock is a term that has been thrown around a lot lately. Some say content marketing as a model may fall apart just because of sheer saturation of content. Others call content shock a myth, since content grows and is created based on changing times. All opinions aside, have a look at the effects of content shock in this graphic and where reality lies within each perspective."

###4. [Google: How Earned Media Impacts Search & New KPIs for PR&nbsp;<i class="icon-link"></i>](http://blog.prnewswire.com/2014/05/05/google-how-earned-media-impacts-search-new-kpis-for-pr/)
>"In a patent for search engine ranking methods that was granted on March 25, Google codified the role earned media plays in search rank.  The patent describes how the search engine values “implied links,” which it describes as a reference to a target resource [i.e. a web site or web page] such as a citation, but does not include an express link to the resource, as part of its process for determining the search rank of a web page. 
What are these implied links?  In a nutshell, they are relevant earned mentions, and run the gamut from media pick up to references on blog posts to mentions in discussion groups."

###5. [7 Blogging Obstacles and Simple Ways to Overcome Them&nbsp;<i class="icon-link"></i>](http://pushingsocial.com/7-blogging-obstacles-clever-ways-overcome/)
>"I’ve been reading Ryan Holiday’s latest barn-burner - The Obstacle is the Way. Get yourself a copy and read it. I plan on reading it twice. Here’s why - The premise of the book is that Obstacles should be accepted. In fact, obstacles are critical to defining who you are, what you want, and what you are made of. Your perception and reaction to Obstacles is what defines and creates success in your life. This is killer stuff.
...
While reading, I kept thinking about the obstacles you face as a content creator and blogger. Taking a cue from the book, I began journaling how to face each obstacle and overcome it."
