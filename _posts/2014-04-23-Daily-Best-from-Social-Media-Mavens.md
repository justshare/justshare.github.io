## The Daily Leaderboard

###1. [6 TIPS TO SET YOURSELF UP FOR SUCCESS WHEN WORKING REMOTELY&nbsp;<i class="icon-link"></i>](http://www.socialmediaexplorer.com/business-innovation-2/6-tips-to-set-yourself-up-for-success-when-working-remotely/)
>"As a full-time remote employee, I feel compelled to put it out there that working remotely is not the equivalent of an employed recluse. Yes, a remote position is different than working out of a traditional office. And, yes, working remotely is not for everyone. But, holding a position as a remote employee still means you are employed by an organization that expects you to be productive and results-driven. There are some major perks, too, like flexibility, no commute-time and fewer distractions."

###2.  [Top Tips for a Terrific Google+ Profile&nbsp;<i class="icon-link"></i>](http://blog.canva.com/top-tips-for-a-terrific-google-profile/)
>"The two areas that you have to make a lasting visual impact are your avatar and your cover photo. Use these spaces wisely to tell the visual story of who you are and give people a reason to follow you. Or not."

###3. [Why Social Media Strategists Matter in the Digital Marketing Realm&nbsp;<i class="icon-link"></i>](http://www.portent.com/blog/social-media/social-media-strategists-matter-digital-marketing-realm.htm)
>"It’s undisputed that other areas of the digital marking world, like SEO or PPC, are valuable to your website and your business because those are areas that increase traffic to your website, and often lead to more conversions. So, why is it that social media gets a bad rap? Why do I continue to work in a field that is constantly the underdog? Short answer: I believe in the power of social media for businesses, and I believe in doing it right. 
I’m going to discuss three reasons why social media (and social media strategists) matter in the digital marketing realm, and perhaps educate other sectors of the digital marketing space who think that we just “play on Facebook all day.”"

###4. [Study: Social Media is Not a Trusted Media Source for PR Pros&nbsp;<i class="icon-link"></i>](http://www.convinceandconvert.com/social-media-research/study-social-media-is-not-a-trusted-media-source-for-pr-pros/)
>"Unsurprisingly, Facebook and Twitter were the most widely used platforms by brands, with LinkedIn and YouTube following closely behind. Interestingly, however, Snapchat is the least-used platform, with only 2 percent of brands using it (also clocking in at 2 percent are brands that use no social channels)."

###5. [Tablet commerce expected to reach 293 billion by 2018 (Infographic)&nbsp;<i class="icon-link"></i>](http://www.marketingpilgrim.com/2014/06/tablet-commerce-expected-to-reach-293-billion-by-2018-infographic.html)
>"2018 may sound like the title of a sci-fi disaster movie but it’s also the year the tablet may take over the ecommerce world. Usablenet predicts the rise of the hand-held machine in their new infographic, saying tablet sales will increase five fold by 2017. That’s over 1 billion tablets and a large percentage of owners will be using those tablets to shop."
