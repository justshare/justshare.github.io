## The Daily Leaderboard

###1. [How Getting Out Can Get You "In" : An Introvert's Confession : Scalable Social Media : Internet Marketing ServicesScalable Social Media – Internet Marketing Services&nbsp;<i class="icon-link"></i>](http://scalablesocialmedia.com/2014/05/networking-introvert/)
>"As much as introverts often do their best work independently, we still benefit from some outside inspiration, no matter what our industry. After all, isn’t that why we go to live conferences? Being physically present cuts down on unproductive multi-tasking, making us really focus on the subject at hand. We also get to learn from others in a very personal way. 
Though meeting new people and carrying on conversation after conversation with strangers can be exhausting, it can also fuel new content, product ideas and services and of course, create lasting connections with others in your industry or with potential customers. Totally worth it."

###2.  [6 Jobs the Best Social Media Managers Actually Do&nbsp;<i class="icon-link"></i>](http://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/best-social-media-manager-job-description)
>"Years after the first "Can we measure the ROI of social media?" blog post, the role of the social media manager has not evolved much in the ways of goal-oriented, metrics-driven marketing. It's possible that this is because many companies haven't figured out the right way to measure the ROI of their efforts -- so they don't know to hire someone that can help them drive real business results. It becomes a vicious cycle -- with little focus on the bottom line efforts from social media, companies relegate the social media role to people without much experience proving bottom-line results, and then once hired, those social media managers don't have experience proving those bottom line efforts.

###3. [Find Ways to Lift Profit Margins Without Much Effort&nbsp;<i class="icon-link"></i>](http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/234549)
>"For any organization, there are different levers that impact profit margins. Some of those are: 
Price. The cost at which you sell your products and services.
Purchasing. The cost at which you buy the good and services you need.
Retention. Your ability to retain current customers.
When we look at why margins are eroding, there are many different reasons -- absenteeism, theft, rising costs, lower prices, commoditization of products and services, employee turnover, the number of touch points to get products and services in the hands of your customers. These are all controllable factors, but many organizations try to control them all at once instead of identifying where the biggest erosion is coming from."

###4. [Winning An Argument&nbsp;<i class="icon-link"></i>](http://www.farnamstreetblog.com/2014/06/winning-an-argument/)
***
Farnam Street is a consistently great blog with very insightful and thoughtful pieces. It is a recent favourite of mine. Highly Recommended. -L

>"We spend a lot of our lives trying to persuade others.
Seth Godin writes: 
*Marketers don’t convince. Engineers convince. Marketers persuade. Persuasion appeals to the emotions and to fear and to the imagination. Convincing requires a spreadsheet or some other rational device. 
It’s much easier to persuade someone if they’re already convinced, if they already know the facts. But it’s impossible to change someone’s mind merely by convincing them of your point*."

###5. [Convert your Twitter followers to email subscribers with a Twitter Lead Generation Card&nbsp;<i class="icon-link"></i>](http://www.niemanlab.org/2014/06/convert-your-twitter-followers-to-email-subscribers-with-a-twitter-lead-generation-card/)
>"Instead of a link to the signup page of our daily email — where you’d have to enter your information, wait to get a confirmation email, then click a link inside it — you get a supersimple one-click interface. Twitter already knows your email address, after all, so that’s prefilled in. Why make someone complete a form and a two-step authentication process when you can make it all easy?"
