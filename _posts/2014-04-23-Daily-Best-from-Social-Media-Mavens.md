###1. [9 Content Curation Ideas for Bulking Up Your Editorial Calendar&nbsp;<i class="icon-link"></i>](http://contentmarketinginstitute.com/2014/07/content-curation-bulk-up-editorial-calendar/)
>"While 93 percent of B2B marketers use content marketing, they’re encountering significant challenges when it comes to creating the quality content needed to satisfy prospects and customers, according to Content Marketing Institute and MarketingProfs 2014 market research. Specifically, they suffer from a lack of adequate time, have trouble producing sufficient amounts of content, and struggle to get budget. 
Creating original content on a consistent basis can require a lot of dedicated resources, both human and financial. So what’s a resource-constrained marketer to do? 
Incorporate content curation into the content marketing mix! According to 2014 Curata research, curated content should account for one-quarter of the content marketing your business produces."

###2.  [Is Your Pinterest Account Follow-Worthy?&nbsp;<i class="icon-link"></i>](https://medium.com/@danielal007/is-your-pinterest-account-follow-worthy-614c30b844d1)
>"First, and most important, you should be adding value. No, it’s not about you. You can pin all your products and over-promote, but if they are not seeing value in your content, they will not click the follow button or even worse, they will click the unfollow button if they are already following you."

###3. [An Open Letter to Webmasters and Clients: Think Beyond Links, Build Compelling Sites with Rich UI and UX&nbsp;<i class="icon-link"></i>](http://www.e2msolutions.com/blog/an-open-letter-to-webmasters-and-clients-think-beyond-links-build-compelling-sites-with-rich-ui-and-ux/)
>"No serious SEO can ignore the elephant in the room: black hat works. For every post informing us that we need to create compelling content in order to rank, there are hundreds or thousands of junky posts ranking on purchased links, private link networks, and tiered linking schemes. Black hat doesn’t work for long, but it does work. 
So why are we sitting here telling you to “think beyond links?” Are we just industry sheeple, regurgitating Google propaganda about how you need “great content” in order to show up in the SERPs? 
No. 
We’re here to tell you that compelling sites take you further than rankings alone, and that UI and UX are musts if you want to optimize any relevant KPIs, as opposed to just optimizing for search."

###4. [5 Stories Your Business Should Be Telling On Pinterest&nbsp;<i class="icon-link"></i>](http://maximizesocialbusiness.com/5-stories-business-telling-pinterest-13041/)
>"Storytelling is the best way to convince your customers that you are the right company with whom to do business. 
Humans have been communicating through stories for over 30,000 years – starting with cave paintings on rock walls. 
Social media storytelling favors all things visual. Marketers and business people who can tell their business stories through photos, videos and other visuals have a distinct advantage over others who use boring business-speak, jargon and dry text. 
Pinterest is the perfect place to frame and share stories with your customers and clients."

###5. [Three Types of Data That Can Help You Connect With Leads&nbsp;<i class="icon-link"></i>](http://www.marketingprofs.com/opinions/2014/25643/three-types-of-data-that-can-help-you-connect-with-leads)
>"Before diving into a pool of information, make sure you're finding the data you need to help accomplish your goals. 
The following three focus areas can drastically improve your marketing efforts and allow you to connect with the leads that can turn into loyal customers. 
Behavioral data 
External triggers 
Sales data"
