###1. [4 Ways to Rewire the Corporate Brain to Compete in the 21st Century&nbsp;<i class="icon-link"></i>](http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/235474)
>"The era of the robber baron is long gone and the days of the rapacious capitalist are dwindling. The corporate world that once rewarded aggression and strong-armed business dealings is now refocusing on collaboration, transparency and corporate responsibility. 
This amounts to an absolute cultural about-face for many companies -- a rewiring of the corporate brain to reward skills that net a more collaborative workplace."

###2.  [Top 5 Ways to Use LinkedIn for Startup Tech Companies&nbsp;<i class="icon-link"></i>](http://www.buildbrandblast.com/top-5-ways-to-use-linkedin-for-startup-tech-companies/)
>"LinkedIn exists as a professional networking platform, and while many people use LinkedIn simply to post their resumes and look for jobs, there are many lesser known functions that startup tech businesses can use to their advantage. 
In a recently posted article, a group of successful individuals from the Young Entrepreneur Council revealed their favorite ways to use LinkedIn for corporate growth. Ranging from simple tricks, like using a “Five Hundred Plus” tool to stay in touch with your contacts, to more advanced tactics like requesting product recommendations, the article delves into some of the most innovative ways to use LinkedIn as a business owner. 
While the same tactics may work differently for different people and different companies, I’ve compiled the five LinkedIn strategies that are most likely to help startup tech company owners generate new business and improve reputation:..."

###3. [Ann Handley and Atri Chatteree Talk: Content Marketing for Small Teams, Part 2&nbsp;<i class="icon-link"></i>](http://blog.act-on.com/2014/07/ann-handley-content-marketing-for-small-teams-part-2/)
>"ATRI:             Content creation is not trivial; it requires a lot of thought and effort. When we asked our own customers what their content marketing concerns were, several asked: What’s the best way to promote our content, given how much effort we’ve put into creating this? And, What are the best channels for this?  
ANN                Looking at the social networks where you are most active, and where your customers are most active or your prospects are most active, is definitely the place to start. I can’t say that there’s one channel that is going to work for every company out there. Because what works for somebody who is interacting quite a bit on Twitter is going to be different than the person who’s on Tumblr or Vine or something like that. So I think it’s important to – as we started this conversation talking about – really know your audience and where they are. 
Look also at your own proclivities. Where do you like to talk to people? Your own passion for a network is something that’s important and it’s definitely going to show. But just broadly speaking, I think if you are a B2B company, I would be looking at LinkedIn. I would be spending a lot of time on LinkedIn and SlideShare. Those are two platforms that are vastly undervalued, particularly SlideShare with B2B companies."

###4. [Marketers Dying By A Thousand Data Points&nbsp;<i class="icon-link"></i>](http://www.portent.com/blog/internet-marketing/marketers-dying-thousand-data-points.htm)
>"Data tells a story about the past, and helps us understand what we can expect in the future. But just like life, data has no guarantees. Even with all the data points and information in the world, it takes an experienced mind to transform insight into meaningful action. 
Marketers need to fill the gap between the past and the future, and find those moments that capture the greatest number of conversions, conversations, and connections. This happens over, and over, and over again. Data, innovations, information – they’re only part of the story. Marketers must spin data into gold, and, as a recent PandoDaily story pointed out, not all marketers are capable of doing so."

###5. [Don't Neglect This Core Component of Great Customer Service &nbsp;<i class="icon-link"></i>](http://www.inc.com/logan-chierotti/don-t-neglect-this-core-component-of-great-customer-service.html)
>"...many business owners miss a key element lurking behind typical customer frustrations. The element is ignorance. 
Not stupidity, but ignorance--a lack of understanding or knowledge. Customers don't always understand the goods and services they buy. Whipping out a checkbook or a credit card is a sign that the customer has been convinced that you might be able to solve his problem. It is not a sign that he grasps all that will go into solving that problem. 
As a result, customers develop unrealistic expectations about how your relationship with them, and how their relationship with your product, should ultimately proceed."
