## The Daily Leaderboard

###1.  [10 Things You Didn’t Know About Decision Making&nbsp;<i class="icon-link"></i>](http://www.lifehack.org/articles/productivity/10-things-you-didnt-know-about-decision-making.html)
>"Making decisions is hard work. The key is to make fewer decisions and reserve your energy for the big ones. President Obama, in a Vanity Fair article, said, “You need to remove from your life the day-to-day problems that absorb most people for meaningful parts of their day… You’ll see I wear only gray or blue suits. I’m trying to pare down decisions. I don’t want to make decisions about what I’m eating or wearing. Because I have too many other decisions to make. You need to focus your decision-making energy. You need to routinize yourself. You can’t be going through the day distracted by trivia.”"

###2. [The Five Aspects of Optimizing Life&nbsp;<i class="icon-link"></i>](http://www.lifeoptimizer.org/2014/06/17/aspects-of-optimizing-life/)
>"...how do we optimize our lives? What are the aspects that we need to optimize?
Well, there are different ways to look at it, but my preferred way is to look at life as it consists of five aspects:
Work: your career and finance.
Health: your physical health.
Learning: your personal development.
Social: your relationships with others.
Spiritual: your relationship with the greater power."

###3. [How to Chill Out: 3 Effective Habits&nbsp;<i class="icon-link"></i>](http://www.positivityblog.com/index.php/2014/07/09/how-to-chill-out/)
>"One very helpful life skill is to be able to chill out. 
To be calm in negative situations and not overreact about all kinds of things. Or invent big, big problems in your mind – or create them in your world as you drag other people in through arguments – by making mountains out of molehills."

###4. [5 Apps to “Gamify” Your Habits and Turn Boring Tasks Into Exciting Ones&nbsp;<i class="icon-link"></i>](http://www.dumblittleman.com/2014/07/5-apps-gamify-habits-turn-boring-tasks-exciting-ones.html)
>"Even if we love our work, it can get old real quick when we do it day in and day out. 
You don’t know how to make work interesting 
Since we inevitably get tired of the daily grind, we need methods to mix it up. We need ways to make the common task feel more… interesting. 
Question is – how? 
Gamify your habits"
