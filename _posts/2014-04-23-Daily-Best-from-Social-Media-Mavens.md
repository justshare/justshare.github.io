###2.  [10 Great Alternatives to the Google Keyword Research Tool&nbsp;<i class="icon-link"></i>](http://www.pamorama.net/2014/01/04/10-keyword-research-tools/)
>"The valuable insights offered by keyword research will inform your strategic process by identifying exactly what your customers want, need, and are concerned about. The demise of Google’s Keyword Tool, the most popular of its kind, has left marketers scrambling for alternatives. Viewed as an essential mechanism for conducting research on keyword phrases, it offered lots of useful information about popularity, competition, and phrase variations. It has been rebranded as Google AdWords Planner, which offers much less functionality and requires users to have an AdWords account in order to use it."
