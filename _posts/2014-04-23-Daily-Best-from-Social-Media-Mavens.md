>"It's possible that email is the Great Time Suck of our professional lives.
I'll cop to (possibly) having lost control of my inbox now and again, swamped by the waves of incoming missives flowing over the transom.  Yet it still remains one of the most convenient and speedy forms of global communication.
That said, we could all probably do less of it.  Much, much less.  But here are six email types worth the electronic ink:"

>"...while most marketers surveyed say they use email marketing as a key strategy for nurturing existing leads and increasing sales, the report shows the channel has serious limitations: 
Email marketing can only reach known prospects 
Email marketing databases may be inaccurate 
In addition, close to 80 percent of marketers surveyed say their email open rates are less than 20 percent on average. And 45 percent think that email marketing converts only one-fourth of known contacts to qualified leads."

>"...it’s widely accepted that it takes at least seven positive marketing messages to make a brand stick in a potential customer’s mind. That means that every single message counts – especially until you’ve “stuck.” If your communications are not consistent with your products and company values, or are insensitive to information you’ve already collected, you may lose some of your highest quality leads. 
Unfortunately, many companies are not effective enough during this delicate phase. Their brand messages aren’t building their credibility, or resonating with the audience receiving them."
