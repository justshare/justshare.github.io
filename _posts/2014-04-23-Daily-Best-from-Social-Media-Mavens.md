>"You can share. You can publish. You can broadcast. You can spam."
>"Social media today requires a commitment of time and energy not only to social media activity, but to understanding it. If you don’t make an investment in understanding social media today, the ease of social media may turn you into a spammer before you realize it."

>"Don’t skew your analysis with incomplete data. You are better off dealing with a quality subset of audience data to analyze rather than a much larger mess of incomplete and questionable data.."
>"A Twitter account with nothing more than an @name, sharing dating site links every hour on the hour, provides little usable data and obviously stinks of spam. Analyze your audience with a tool that allows you to filter out incomplete and junk accounts."

###3. [Social Media Spam Is Spam&nbsp;<i class="icon-link"></i>](http://www.steamfeed.com/social-media-spam-spam/)
>"Yes, identify your target audience on social media, but then connect with them, converse with them and earn a relationship that warrants the prospect to look deeper at your profile. Establish a relationship that enables you to bring up one of your blog posts or the product you provide. Do it in context to a conversation and AFTER you’ve done the work to provide value and connection."

###4. [Social Media Marketing without the Spam&nbsp;<i class="icon-link"></i>](http://thecatalystpartnership.wordpress.com/2012/02/26/social-media-marketing-without-the-spam/)
>"Selfish campaigns will have little gain. Instead, think about what your reader wants to hear, see or talk about. Engage the reader, ask questions and encourage reposting/shares."
>"A consistent brand is essential to your social media marketing campaign and to the reputation of your business. You want to post fresh, relevant content often. Don’t post something just for the sake of posting it or to gain attention. "
