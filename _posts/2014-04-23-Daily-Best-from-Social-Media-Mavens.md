## The Daily Leaderboard

###1. [Marketers Don’t Need to Be More Creative&nbsp;<i class="icon-link"></i>](http://blogs.hbr.org/2014/06/marketers-dont-need-to-be-more-creative/)
>"If there’s anything all that chaos and competition of the past five years should have taught agencies, it’s that too much “creativity” celebrated by marketers and advertisers really isn’t. Advertising creativity has long been a bit of a con job; the media world is filled with costly creative that neither builds brands nor sells products. The better argument is that traditional advertising and marketing firms have pathologically overinvested in creativity while consistently underinvesting in meaningful metrics. An even better case might be made that the multimedia successes of Google, Twitter, Pinterest, Instagram, Facebook, and so on, highlight just how flaccid and ineffective most creative advertising and market work has been. What’s the secret sauce these technologies all have in common? Their creativity is measurable, trackable, and accountable. That’s a winning combination. If you’re a brand manager or CMO, that’s what you should care about."

###2.  [Common SEO Obstacles Big Brands Face and How to Overcome Them
&nbsp;<i class="icon-link"></i>](http://www.business2community.com/seo/common-seo-obstacles-big-brands-face-overcome-0917944#!4gMkC)
>"Whether you’re brand new to the scene or you’ve been around for awhile, exposure is key. You could sell the best cat toys out there, but no cat will ever experience them if you’re not marketing to the public. Start with your website: optimize your metadata, check your alt tags, fix internal links, etc. Find opportunities to help you grow in the rankings and dive deep.
If your content is thin, you could be in danger of a Google penalty. Target keywords with high search volume and pair these keywords with relevant landing pages. Optimize the metadata on these pages and together, these efforts will help you rank in the search results."
