## The Daily Leaderboard

###1.  [10 Ways To Reboot Your Productivity Today&nbsp;<i class="icon-link"></i>](http://www.asianefficiency.com/productivity/10-ways-reboot-productivity-today/)
>"My Evernote was open and I rewrote my life goals. WordPress was open and I re-edited an old post. An article I had written on another forum was open and I decided to post it on my blog. Omnifocus was open and I started messing with the controls. My notes were open which lead to some unnecessary research which lead me to some unnecessary HipChatting with a co-worker. 
That, my friends, is how not clearing to neutral leads to 3 hours of unproductive time. Worse yet, it was morning, the time I normally work the best. If I had taken the time the night before to close all of my programs and tabs, I would not have lost half a day running down unproductive rabbit holes."

###2. [The Key to a Better Day at Work: E-mail Less, Flow More&nbsp;<i class="icon-link"></i>](http://blog.pickcrew.com/to-work-better-focus-on-flow/)
>"Researchers at the University of Chicago and Microsoft decided to look into how e-mail disrupts our work day by logging workers interactions with their computer and monitoring their tasks. 
Say you have a primary task, like working on a report. Then you receive an alert telling you that you have a new e-mail (that’s a diversion). Each time we experience a disruption at work we go through what is called an interruption life cycle..."

###3. [The Prepared Writer’s Process for Creating Excellent Content Every Day&nbsp;<i class="icon-link"></i>](http://www.copyblogger.com/content-every-day/)
>"I’ve been a writer for over a decade. 
I began as a journalist and my reporting experience has greatly contributed to the success of my blog, but for reasons you might not expect. 
Of course I was trained to follow grammar rules and avoid commonly misused words, but the real value was the practice of writing daily, on subjects I didn’t necessarily care about, and meeting a deadline. 
I also knew that potentially thousands of people were going to read my work, so mediocre effort was not an option. 
During those years of reporting, and throughout more than five years of blogging, I’ve also never encountered writer’s block. In fact, I don’t believe it actually exists. 
Why?"

###4. [Forget The “To-Do” List, You Need A ‘Stop Doing’ List&nbsp;<i class="icon-link"></i>](http://www.farnamstreetblog.com/2014/07/jim-collins-stop-doing-list/)
>"It’s interesting to think about the things you want to accomplish in life and work towards those goals. 
This is, after all, what we’ve been taught to do since birth. But over time we accumulate other habits and end up spending our time on things that aren’t important to us. 
Jim Collins, author of the cult business classics Good to Great and Great by Choice, suggests an interesting thought experiment to help clean the windshield so-to-speak. 
*Suppose you woke up tomorrow and received two phone calls. The first phone call tells you that you have inherited $20 million, no strings attached. The second tells you that you have an incurable and terminal disease, and you have no more than 10 years to live. What would you do differently, and, in particular, what would you stop doing?* 
What would you stop doing?"

###5. [12 Quiet Rituals of Enormously Successful Humans&nbsp;<i class="icon-link"></i>](http://www.marcandangel.com/2014/07/06/12-quiet-rituals-of-enormously-successful-humans/)
>"The result of enormous success is often pretty noisy – lots of people talking, writing and sharing stories about it.  The actual process of achieving enormous success, on the other hand, is far more discreet.  But it’s this process that happens quietly, behind-the-scenes, that makes all the difference in the world."
