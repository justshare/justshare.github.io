###2. [DOUBLE DELIGHT BY GREGORY CIOTTI: A Visual Asset is worth 1000 words&nbsp;<i class="icon-link"></i>](http://www.gregoryciotti.com/visual-assets/)
>"... a visual asset is any graphic, chart, or visual display of information within a piece of content that helps elaborate the point you are trying to make.
I feel that the effective use of these smaller bits of visual information will long outlast ‘infographics’ (which have been on the way out for some time). People love charts and visual representations — they are timeless, much more so than the gross looking, 2000px long infogarbage that the blogosphere has become accustomed to."

###3. [DOUBLE DELIGHT BY GREGORY CIOTTI: The Best Way to Change Your Habits? Control Your Environment&nbsp;<i class="icon-link"></i>](http://www.sparringmind.com/changing-habits/#more-1617)
>"Since we know that discipline is built like a muscle—and can likewise be worn out—environmental changes might be useful in getting ourselves to do difficult tasks regularly."

###4. [How to Hire a Social-Media Director&nbsp;<i class="icon-link"></i>](http://tinytorch.com/how-to-hire-a-social-media-director/)
>"Chances are pretty high that person/intern you assigned to manage your social media campaign is the wrong person. In part, this is due to the fact that most of us don’t even understand how “content marketing” is different from “traditional” marketing practices.
As a result, it becomes difficult for us to hire the right person and to know what the appropriate goals/objectives should be. Most of us have made this mistake at one point in our life."

###5. [Perfecting the Art of Writing Quickly: 5 Tips&nbsp;<i class="icon-link"></i>](http://www.theprocrastiwriter.com/perfecting-art-writing-quickly-5-tips/)
>"Over the past 5 years since I’ve graduated college and exited the world of (what seemed to me like) virtually unlimited free time to think and write and lay on lawns mown by someone else in a beach towel with my laptop and water bottle, it’s been a struggle for me to master the art of writing quickly. I found it so difficult, in fact, that one of my writing “rituals” was ensuring that I’d blocked off at least two, maybe even 3, hours of pure, unadulterated writing time.
...
But when I graduated from college, that particular writing habit became a writing block that prevented me from actually writing in any meaningful fashion. I never had the time to feel comfortable enough to make a meaningful effort. But that, like some many other problems, was all in my head."
