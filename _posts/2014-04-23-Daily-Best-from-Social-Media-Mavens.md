## The Daily Leaderboard

###1. [Why Instagram is becoming the dominant social network&nbsp;<i class="icon-link"></i>](url)
>"I haven’t posted an external video on this blog in years, but I think this content is definitely grow-worthy because it forces you to look at our online world through a new dataset, a new lens, that is quite thought-provoking and perhaps even disturbing.
The speaker in the video, Scott Galloway has a think tank called L2 and is also a marketing professor at NYU Stern. In this fast-paced talk he uses his research to make predictions on who is winning and losing in everything from social media and retail to brands and world economies."

###2.  [These Are The Surprising Jobs You'll Be Doing By The 2030s&nbsp;<i class="icon-link"></i>](http://io9.com/these-are-the-surprising-jobs-youll-be-doing-by-the-203-1577363367)
>"As our technological and sociological realities change, so too do our jobs. But just what, exactly, will we be doing 15 years from now? Here are some completely unexpected jobs you've almost certainly never heard of—but likely will soon. 
Indeed, the landscape of careers is changing. But knowing which vocations are around the corner is not obvious."

###3. [The Future of PageRank: 13 Experts on the Dwindling Value of the Link&nbsp;<i class="icon-link"></i>](http://www.searchenginejournal.com/future-pagerank-13-experts-dwindling-value-link/101881/)
>"In a recent Webmaster video, Matt Cutts confirmed that Google has tried internal versions of its search engine that work entirely without links. The results are low-quality – “for now,” he said. But this suggests that the value of the almighty link has come into question at Google, and they may be working on a version of the PageRank algorithm that doesn’t depend so heavily on the link graph – which means PageRank as we know it might be on the chopping block. But when?"

###4. [The Anonymous Social Media Trend is Forcing Marketers to Innovate to Win Consumers’ Trust&nbsp;<i class="icon-link"></i>](http://www.business2community.com/social-media/anonymous-ocial-media-trend-forcing-marketers-innovate-win-consumers-trust-0877204)
>"Anonymous social apps are on the rise. A recent rumour that Facebook has offered $100m to purchase Secret, an app allowing users to share messages anonymously, is unconfirmed, but it is a sign that the social network is taking the trend – and people accusing Facebook of intruding into their privacy – seriously. Other signs include the company’s plans to display a ‘privacy checkup’ message for users who share their posts publicly and to give users the ability to log into third-party apps anonymously.  
... internet users’ privacy concerns are increasing, meaning that marketers will have to adapt the way they advertise to appeal to the privacy-conscious consumer."

###5. [Is Your Social Media Failing?&nbsp;<i class="icon-link"></i>](url)
>"Social media is moving at warp speed and most people who are charged with managing the content and distribution are not well equipped to handle the ever-changing social eco-system. I have seen this over and over again and was in that position once myself. Then, I started investing time, resources and energy on how to best utilize the resources I have to figure out what are my obstacles in my may that are preventing me from succeeding."
