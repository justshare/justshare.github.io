## The Daily Leaderboard

###1. [Facebook Save — A New Read-It-Later Option For Facebook Posts & Pages&nbsp;<i class="icon-link"></i>](http://marketingland.com/facebook-introduces-way-save-91887)
>"Facebook tied up one of the loose ends in its mobile and web product today, announcing a bookmarking feature that allows users to save posts for later viewing. 
The new feature, called Save, is arriving fairly late in the read-it-later game, behind well developed services like Pocket and Instapaper that have grown popular with people looking to store their reading lists in one convenient place. Those services also cache stories to be read offline. Facebook’s doesn’t. But Facebook’s Save does has something no similar product has: the enormous scale of Facebook’s 1.28 billion active users. 
And Save also includes a wrinkle that could be a boon for local businesses, and marketers of movies, TV shows and the music industry. Facebook is enabling users to bookmark Facebook Pages representing such entities."

###2.  [The Evolution of Social Selling&nbsp;<i class="icon-link"></i>](http://blogs.salesforce.com/company/2014/07/the-evolution-of-social-selling-gp.html)
>"Not just a tool for marketing, social media becomes a precision instrument for social selling. The art of listening and engagement at a global scale can be very profitable if done right. 
The social buying process has turned sales sideways and given the buyer more control. Buyers no longer have to get information from salespeople; today, they can self-educate, research best-of-breed technologies, and ask their trusted connections for recommendations. 
Now, instead of making lengthy discovery calls, sales professionals are expected to have social insights on their prospects and an understanding of what’s going in the industry.  
These new trends have led to interesting new developments. For instance, executives may even follow other executives' social profiles in an attempt to stay connected, informed, and available for collaboration whenever it’s feasible. 
The age of social selling is upon us. High-performing companies like IBM, ADT and Salesforce (among others) are already reaping the financial and brand benefits of empowering their sales teams with training in social selling and access to the best tools available. "

###3. [Beyond Engagement: The Art of Managing Social-Media Risk in Employee Advocacy&nbsp;<i class="icon-link"></i>](http://www.socialmediatoday.com/content/beyond-engagement-art-managing-social-media-risk-employee-advocacy)
>"Decision-making in business – in professionally run organizations, at least – has always involved some form of risk assessment, allowing the potential return from a project to be evaluated alongside the worst-case outcome. 
Given its ubiquitous nature, and whether business leaders like it or not, social media is now part of the risk-reward mix; leadership teams everywhere are now trying to take decisions that have none of the easy familiarity associated with “traditional” investment. 
The difficulty for proponents of social-media initiatives in general – and employee advocacy in particular – is overcoming the fear and ignorance that is widespread among C-level executives in companies around the globe. There’s plenty of evidence, both scientific and anecdotal, that “It’s too risky” has become a knee-jerk reaction to anything that smacks of social-media empowerment for employees."

###4. [Boost Business by Choosing the Best Social Relationship Platform For You&nbsp;<i class="icon-link"></i>](http://blog.hootsuite.com/chooosing-the-best-social-relationship-platform/)
>"Because the social enterprise space is constantly in flux (like social media), it can be somewhat of a daunting task to know which social relationship platform is right for you and your organization. From understanding what your organization needs to being aware of what your social media presence is like, there is a lot to consider. 
Here are some important factors to consider when determining an enterprise social media solution:"
