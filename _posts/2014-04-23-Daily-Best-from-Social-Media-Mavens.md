## The Daily Leaderboard

###1. [What's The Future Of The Sharing Economy?&nbsp;<i class="icon-link"></i>](http://www.fastcoexist.com/1679964/whats-the-future-of-the-sharing-economy)
>"More recently, there has been a surge in peer-to-peer sharing, and formal sharing institutions are quickly becoming a thing of the past. It doesn’t require an in-depth analysis to recognize the role of technology in this shift. What started online as the sharing of information has quickly turned into a full-fledged economy, with individuals sharing their homes, cars, and skills with the help of mobile devices.
...
This intersection of sharing and technology has contributed to an “own less, use more” mindset, backed by environmentalists and economists alike. By skipping platforms that require the production of new assets, like car rental agencies and hotels, we--as a society--are ultimately able to produce fewer goods while still having access to a broad variety of goods and services. The potential environmental impacts are significant: When measuring carbon emissions, home sharing is 66% more effective than hotels where as car sharing participants reduce their individual emissions by 40%."

###2.  [The black economy and the internet age&nbsp;<i class="icon-link"></i>](http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/777b8ae8-cc56-11e3-bd33-00144feabdc0.html#axzz31V1ZkI2E)
>"House swapping isn’t new, but the ease with which it can now be done on the internet means it is on the rise. I’ve even looked at the possibilities for my own house (town house in Edinburgh during the Festival in exchange for a beach house in Martha’s Vineyard, anyone?) You might think that as no cash changes hands this is a purely social phenomenon and therefore of very little interest to this column’s readers. But it isn’t really so. Look at swapping through the eyes of an accountant or an economist and you will see that it should eventually have major implications for the ways in which we measure the size of the economy and collect tax."

###3. [The Sharing Economy Isn’t About Trust, It’s About Desperation&nbsp;<i class="icon-link"></i>](http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2014/04/sharing-economy-is-about-desperation.html)
>"A huge precondition for the sharing economy has been a depressed labor market, in which lots of people are trying to fill holes in their income by monetizing their stuff and their labor in creative ways. In many cases, people join the sharing economy because they've recently lost a full-time job and are piecing together income from several part-time gigs to replace it. In a few cases, it's because the pricing structure of the sharing economy made their old jobs less profitable. (Like full-time taxi drivers who have switched to Lyft or Uber.) In almost every case, what compels people to open up their homes and cars to complete strangers is money, not trust."

>"A growing number of apps and online services are giving consumers more direct control over their choices. But are they cutting-edge conveniences that should be encouraged, or rapidly expanding businesses that need more regulation?"

###5. [5 Ways to Make Your Brand Thrive in the Sharing Economy&nbsp;<i class="icon-link"></i>](http://www.inc.com/diane-hessan/5-ways-to-make-your-brand-thrive-in-the-sharing-economy.html?cid=em01016week16b)
>"Smart brands needn't be threatened by the collaborative movement. Instead of holing themselves up in branded ivory towers, pioneering companies are redefining their relationships with consumers to form an active collaboration with them or other independent partners. These partnerships can create mutually beneficial change and empower organizations to make faster (and smarter) business decisions. Here are five ways brands can not only embrace, but thrive in the sharing economy."
