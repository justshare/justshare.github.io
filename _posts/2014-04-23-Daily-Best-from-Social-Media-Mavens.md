###1. [What To Do When Your Small Business Has Growing Pains&nbsp;<i class="icon-link"></i>](http://blogs.salesforce.com/company/2014/04/small-business-growing-pains-gp.html)
>For many entrepreneurs, having a business is like having a baby and while we love it unconditionally, it’s easy to get impatient and frustrated when the startup suffers unexpected setbacks.
Keep cool and avoid having a startup version of the “terrible twos” with these tips

###3. [Stop Trying to be Human - Try Being Useful&nbsp;<i class="icon-link"></i>](http://www.socialmediaexplorer.com/social-media-marketing/stop-trying-to-be-human-try-being-useful/)
>It’s natural to want to connect with people and their personalities on social. It is however, un-natural to “engage” with a product or brand. I almost never talk to my pillow. I occasionally talk to my treadmill, but not in a nice, friendly way. So, let’s drop this whole notion of being more human and try instead to be useful.

###4. [Stop Trying to Get Your Blog Posts Shared and Do This Instead&nbsp;<i class="icon-link"></i>](http://socialmouths.com/blog/2014/04/16/stop-trying-to-get-your-blog-posts-shared-and-do-this-instead/)
>Here’s the problem. Blog posts just aren’t very shareable. Take a minute and scroll through your Facebook feed right now. Keep scrolling until you find a blog post in there. Yeah, it’s going to be a while.
Meanwhile, average organic reach has dropped from 16 percent in 2012 all the way down to 6.51 percent this year. (Oh how I long for the days when we complained about 16 percent organic reach.)
I’m going to say something a bit heretical. I don’t think you should focus on getting your blog posts shared.
I think you should start asking what does get shared instead.

###5. [How we generated $13k of sales in 24hrs through Product Hunt&nbsp;<i class="icon-link"></i>](https://medium.com/on-startups/4ab5a28f018c)
>Here’s the trick: we didn’t pull any tricks. One of our customers unexpectedly posted us to Product Hunt, and we resonated with every customer. And if you build a resonating experience, people tell their friends.
