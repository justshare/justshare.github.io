###1. [How Graphics Can Increase Your Conversion Rate – Starting Today&nbsp;<i class="icon-link"></i>](http://blog.canva.com/graphics-increase-conversion-rate/)
>"It might sound hard to believe, but the right images can have a major impact on your conversion rate.  All other things created equal (you have an outstanding product, amazing customer service and a beautiful, mobile-responsive website, to name a few), great images are the icing on the cake. But the images you choose and how you choose to display them are far more important."

>"The most significant announcement for app publishers and advertisers were updates made to the iTunes App Store. There will now be an Explore tab, with trending searches, faster search, related searches, editors picks, and discounted bundles. Users will now be able to more easily discover new apps; they will have multiple ways of finding exactly the app they are looking for. 
Trending searches, which will most likely be modeled after the Twitter trending function, will show popular searches; it will also help people find apps related to a specific topic.

###4. [Create Real Relationships to Get Real Results&nbsp;<i class="icon-link"></i>](http://ownermag.com/real-relationships-real-results/)
>"When I talk about “real relationships,” I’m not referring to networking or “making connections.” Those are often preliminary steps to building relationships, but true relationships require a deeper level of commitment. They require an investment of time and emotion. They demand a willingness to be vulnerable and let others see behind your masks into the real you. They command you to ask “how can I best serve?” and obligate you to allow yourself to be served as well."

###5. [6 Timeless Tips for Writing Great Web Content&nbsp;<i class="icon-link"></i>](http://justcreative.com/2014/05/23/tips-for-writing-web-content/)
>"One good thing about creating compelling web content is having the freedom to write anything that interests you and your readers. You don’t have to follow strict writing rules because what matters most is the life and personality of your posts. Web content is different from other writing forms. Readers rarely hang on to every word you write. They like to scan and they are only after what you can offer them."
