## The Daily Leaderboard

###1. [Content Modelling: The Most Overlooked Route To A Successful WordPress Site&nbsp;<i class="icon-link"></i>](http://premium.wpmudev.org/blog/content-modelling-the-most-overlooked-route-to-a-successful-wordpress-site/)
>"Too many WordPress site owners force round pegs into square holes by building their sites on the built-in content model of posts, pages, categories and tags, creating major long-term headaches and constraints for the design and management of the site. 
Taking a little time up front in the design process, or even overhauling a current site, to create a content model that genuinely reflects the type and range of content you are publishing will dramatically increase your site’s flexibility and provide a superior experience for both you, the site owner, and your visitors."

###2.  [The difference between traffic and audience&nbsp;<i class="icon-link"></i>](http://thenextweb.com/entrepreneur/2014/05/25/difference-traffic-audience/)
>"Unlike a typical blog where readers view one or two stories before departing, visitors to NiceKicks.com view over eight pages per visit on average. And the site has a bigger social footprint than startup-famous tech companies like MapMyRun, Dell, and RetailMeNot. 
NiceKicks has traffic, certainly. But more importantly, it obtained an audience — a group of engaged, loyal readers that spend time reading its content and return to the site frequently. 
It’s audience, not traffic, that is the holy grail for brand marketers today. And after getting frequently questioned about the difference between the two, I decided to write this post and share what I’ve learned."

###3. [The Lean Startup is a Mindset And NOT a Rulebook&nbsp;<i class="icon-link"></i>](http://ramlijohn.com/lean-startup-mindset/)
>"People who criticize the Lean Startup miss the point. The Lean Startup is a not a commandment or rulebook that must be followed. It’s not a secret step-by-step startup cookbook that will bring clarity to confusion, as Kevin Dewalt said in his blog. 
This shallow understanding of the Lean Startup misses the nuances and critical thought required to frame each experiment. It misses the thought process and conversation with your team required to ask the important questions to your customers. You’ve just replaced the hard task of strategy and critical thought with the lazy solution of following someone else’s process."

###4. [7 Costly Technology Mistakes Made by Content Marketers&nbsp;<i class="icon-link"></i>](http://www.razorsocial.com/content-marketers-technology/)
>"If you are in the world of content marketing and are not allocating sufficient time to the technology side of things, then you are likely to be wasting a lot of time.  It’s easy to get consumed by the creation of content, but smart content creation requires a lot of thought and planning. 
In this article we outline 7 costly technology mistakes made by content marketers, and I’d love to hear if any of these resonate with you."

###5. [THE 7 DWARVES OF CONTENT MARKETING&nbsp;<i class="icon-link"></i>](http://www.minttwist.com/blog/2014/05/12/the-7-dwarves-of-content-marketing/)
>"The ultimate team in fairy tales is the Seven Dwarves, each with their own unique characteristics. Creating great content is the same – it needs different skills and approaches.  Getting buy-in from people around your business to help create and repurpose content will support content marketing and SEO efforts."
