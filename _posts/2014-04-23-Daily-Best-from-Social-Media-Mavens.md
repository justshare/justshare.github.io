###1. [How to Spot the Weakest Part of Your Blog Post (and What to Do About It)&nbsp;<i class="icon-link"></i>](http://www.copyblogger.com/strengthen-your-weaknesses/)
>"The goal of a typical first draft is to transform your scattered thoughts into a cohesive article that explains a topic to your target audience. But why should readers choose your content over another writer’s work? 
If you don’t take the time to revise your rough draft in a way that shows you are an authority, and that you have a solution that isn’t available anywhere else, they won’t. 
To help you narrow down the sections of your blog posts that could use improvement, here are eight common weaknesses I see over and over in drafts that are sent to me for editing. 
And, more important, quick and easy ways to strengthen each one."

###2.  [Where Search Fits in the Digital Marketing Mix – 12 Lessons from Lee Odden Keynote at MnSummit&nbsp;<i class="icon-link"></i>](http://www.toprankblog.com/2014/06/12-lessons-digital-marketing/)
>"Libraries aren’t the only organizations feeling the impact from our increasing preferences for online information. A study by Accenture Interactive recently reported that digital marketing is predicted to account for 75% of CMOs budgets over the next five years. And yet 79% of them don’t believe their businesses will be ready. 
Stop and think about that for a minute. An overwhelming majority of C-level executives don’t think their business will be ready for the vast majority of their marketing to be digital, meeting the information consumption habits of their consumers. How on earth do they expect to attract and engage them?"

###3. [How to Optimize Your Older Blog Content for Long Tail Conversion&nbsp;<i class="icon-link"></i>](http://unbounce.com/content-marketing/how-to-optimize-your-old-blog-content-for-long-tail-conversion/)
>"A few weeks ago I was talking to Joe Chernov of HubSpot, a leading marketing software company with a very active blog community. As VP of Content, Joe’s role is to ensure that HubSpot’s content is consistently high in quality and driving valuable lead gen. 
One of the surprising insights from our conversation was that Joe found that many of HubSpot’s older blog posts from prior months or even years were getting extremely high conversion long tail traffic. 
It turned out that people digging deep into the blog’s archives had a very specific pain point to address. Accordingly, HubSpot saw conversion rates much higher than that of their most recent posts, albeit at lower volume. This is why Joe’s team continues to tinker with older posts. 
If it can work for HubSpot, it can work for you. Here are three things you can do to optimize older evergreen posts on your blog for long tail conversion."
