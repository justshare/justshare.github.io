###1. [Three Tricks To Step Up Your Self-Promotion Skills&nbsp;<i class="icon-link"></i>](http://www.forbes.com/sites/work-in-progress/2014/05/23/three-tricks-to-step-up-your-self-promotion-skills/)
>"I recently attended a women’s leadership dinner and heard a young woman ask the speaker—a corporate woman executive—her best strategy for promoting her accomplishments. Coolly, the executive responded, “Have others do it for you.” 
Ever since, I’ve been turning this advice over uncomfortably in my head. 
I’m the first person to say that you need to enlist others in your career advancement. And of course, it helps your career if people speak positively about you when you’re not around. 
But taking an “outer” approach to self-promotion puts an awful lot of hope and trust in others. And it negates your own voice and power to… a mere whisper."

###2.  [Guiding the Customer Journey&nbsp;<i class="icon-link"></i>](http://www.briansolis.com/2014/05/guiding-customer-journey/)
>"Today, a kinder, gentler form of marketing called inbound marketing relies primarily on the creation and distribution of content in an effort to “be found.”
The foundation of the inbound approach is based to use heaps of content to draw people into you marketing funnel. And, while this has proven effective, many marketers simply interpret this to mean you create more demand by creating more content. 
The problem with this thinking is that it’s really just the same old approach polished up with more information. 
Today, marketing is about guiding a journey that the buyer wants to take rather than forcing them into the journey that fits our business model. 
People don’t really need more information, they need insight, they need guidance and they need an experience that allows them to behave like they want to behave.
So, in many ways the future of marketing is less about creating demand and more about understanding and organizing behavior."

###4. [Why You Can't Get Rich Working For Someone Else&nbsp;<i class="icon-link"></i>](http://www.businessinsider.com/get-rich-working-for-yourself-2014-5)
>"Regardless of whether you work for yourself or someone else, are you putting your money to the best use? 
Saving a portion of your paycheck is great, and we should always have some money put away in the bank. You know what's better, though? Investing. 
According to Bankrate.com, the highest return you'll see on your money is 1.05% from a GE Capital Retail Bank CD. The minimum deposit on that is $25,000. Don't have that lying around? Then you're looking at less than 1%. 
Here's the math. To make an extra $100 a week off of interest, you would need a) $100,000 in the bank and b) a 5% interest rate (good luck finding that). Essentially, the bank is making more money off you than you are off them."
