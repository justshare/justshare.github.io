## The Daily Leaderboard

###1. [What Is Long-Form Content and Why Does It Work?&nbsp;<i class="icon-link"></i>](http://socialmediatoday.com/larrykim/2399801/what-long-form-content-and-why-does-it-work) 
>"We used to be skeptics, too. Our average piece of content was around 1,000 words or fewer. We focused heavily on SEO, including keyword optimization. The only problem with this strategy? We were getting a lot of search traffic, but not a lot of return traffic, direct traffic, or brand searches, and our user engagement metrics – stuff like bounce rate and time on site – were pretty low. 
So we switched up our tactics a bit and started incorporating more long-form articles into our content strategy. The goal was to increase user engagement – and it worked extraordinarily well."

###2.  [On Privilege and Luck, or Why Success Breeds Success&nbsp;<i class="icon-link"></i>](http://phenomena.nationalgeographic.com/2014/04/28/on-privilege-and-luck-or-why-success-breeds-success/)
>"Ask successful people about the secrets of their success, and you’ll probably answers like passion, hard work, skill, focus, and having great ideas. Very few people, if any, would reply with “privilege and luck”. We’re often blind to these factors and they make for less inspiring stories. But time and again, we see that the advantages that give us a head-start and the accidents that ease our path can make or break a career."

###3. [This is what comes after search&nbsp;<i class="icon-link"></i>](http://qz.com/205689/context-this-is-what-comes-after-search/)
>"Context-aware software for smartphones is all the rage among tech giants. In just the past year, Twitter bought Android home screen startup Cover, Apple bought smart assistant Cue, Yahoo bought Cover competitor Aviate, and of course Google has pioneered the field of learning everything about a person so that it can push data to them before they even know they need it, with its Google Now service. 
Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer has been especially explicitly about what this new age of context means. “Contextual search aims to give people the right information, at the right time, by looking at signals such as where they’re located and what they’re doing—such as walking or driving a car,” she said at a recent conference. "Mobile devices tend to provide a lot more of those signals….When I look at things like contextual search, I get really excited.""

###4. [16 DIY Tools for Social Media Management&nbsp;<i class="icon-link"></i>](http://www.business2community.com/infographics/16-diy-tools-social-media-management-0873709)
>"A little bit about our research process: To be as objective as possible, all of the information for the infographic was pulled directly from the websites of each of the sixteen services featured. When something was unclear, we personally reached out to companies for clarification. 
We then combined all our findings into an infographic which features well-known niche tools across three major categories: Social Messaging/Scheduling, Analytics and Social Landing Pages (promotions/apps)."

###5. [5 Ways Companies in Regulated Industries Can Use Social Media&nbsp;<i class="icon-link"></i>](http://www.inc.com/carrie-kerpen/5-ways-companies-in-regulated-industries-can-use-social-media.html)
>"For those who work in regulated industries like financial, legal, insurance, or health, it can feel like an impossible task to craft a plan to use social media. After all, these industries have heavy rules and requirements, and, especially for a small-business owner, it can feel like more trouble than it's worth.  
However, the opportunities for companies in these sectors to use social media marketing are vast. It's just knowing how to proceed that makes all of the difference."
