###1. [Breaking the SEO Rules: When Not to Follow Best Practices - Whiteboard Friday&nbsp;<i class="icon-link"></i>](http://moz.com/blog/breaking-the-seo-rules-when-not-to-follow-best-practices-whiteboard-friday)
>"For example, a best practice would be that your meta description length is only so long, or that your title tag length is 512 pixels or something like that. So when we talk about best practices, we're talking about a set of rules that are consistently showing superior results. It doesn't mean they're the only way you can do things, but in general, over time, they deliver the best results over other techniques. 
Best practices are also used as a benchmark so that when you compare two different techniques, such as title tag length is this long or title tag length is that long, one set of those results you can use as a benchmark to measure your results. 
Finally, best practices are meant to evolve and improve. Best practices get better over time. If you're running a business or you're doing SEO, your best practices are going to change the better you get at what you're doing and the more you learn. This is one thing that people often forget -- that best practices do change."

###2.  [How I Became the Person Most Mentioned by Digital Marketers on Twitter&nbsp;<i class="icon-link"></i>](http://www.convinceandconvert.com/convince-convert/how-i-became-the-person-most-mentioned-by-digital-marketers-on-twitter/)
>"I remember selling my digital agency in 2005 and planning to teach at a university when my earn out concluded in 2008. 
I remember the simultaneous real estate and stock market collapses in 2008 putting that plan on indefinite hold, resulting in me starting a new consulting firm. 
I remember that this consulting firm (which was a “firm” in name only, since it was just me in my house) originally being devoted to conversion rate optimization, hence the name “Convince & Convert” – which was partially chosen because the domain name was available. 
I remember hiring my good friend Chris Bohnsack to create a series of logo options, and over beers at a craft brewery outside of Tucson, settling on the very distinctive one you see here. 
I remember deciding that the website for this new firm would include a blog, which perplexed me since I’d only written about 3 blog posts in my life."

###3. [The 5 Most Important Slides For Content Marketers From Mary Meeker’s Internet Report&nbsp;<i class="icon-link"></i>](http://contently.com/strategist/2014/05/30/the-5-most-important-slides-for-content-marketers-from-mary-meekers-internet-report/)
>"It’s that time of the year. No, not beach season, but the release of Mary Meeker’s annual Internet Report, that monumental moment when we find out what the esteemed analyst thinks about the state of technology and the Internet. It’s one of the biggest annual events in the tech and marketing industries, and possibly one of the only good reasons to put away the sunscreen and hunker down indoors this weekend. 
But we want you to have a good time, so we went through the report and found the five nuggets you need to know."

###4. [So you think you know social sharing . . .think again (Infographic)&nbsp;<i class="icon-link"></i>](http://www.marketingpilgrim.com/2014/05/so-you-think-you-know-social-sharing-think-again-infographic.html)
>"An enormous amount of internet content comes with built in social or email sharing buttons but folks are still using Ctrl+C to share! Since the majority of these shares are coming from IOS devices, I think there’s more to this than meets the eye. (Excuse me Transformers for borrowing your slogan.) I’m thinking about how I might share a photo on Instagram. I find it on the internet. Save it to my photos then reupload through Instagram. Does that count as copy and paste?
Maybe these actions are happening because of messenger apps. I’m texting with you and I want you to see this crazy quote from my favorite TV star so I cut it from the web and past it in the text message box. 
No matter how you figure it, it’s a low blow for Facebook and Twitter."
