###1. [7 Ways To Grow Your Business With Linkedin&nbsp;<i class="icon-link"></i>](http://blog.canva.com/grow-business-with-linkedin/)

###2. [Guy Kawasaki: 'If You're Using Social Media Right, You Will Piss Some People Off'&nbsp;<i class="icon-link"></i>](http://www.businessinsider.com/guy-kawasaki-on-small-business-social-media-2014-5/)
>"What is the most common mistake you see companies make?  
   
GK: Almost every company is not posting as much as they should. Many are believing "expert" advice that the optimal number of posts on each platform is one per day. This is the stupidest thing I've heard. Imagine if NPR, CNN, ESPN, or the BBC did one report per day — and never repeated it. Companies are afraid of a vocal minuscule minority complaining about too many posts and repeated posts.
    
If you're using social media right, you will piss some people off. Deal with it. My   Twitter account has 50 tweets per day. My Google+ has 10 to 20 per day. It's not how much you post. It's how good you post."

###3.  [4 Ways Brands Can Use Local Search to Their Advantage [INFOGRAPHIC]&nbsp;<i class="icon-link"></i>](http://dashburst.com/infographic/how-to-local-search-ads/)
>"According to Google, four in every five people use search engines to find products or services nearby. These local searches have a high potential to drive traffic through your doors and, most importantly, drive sales in the immediate future.  
  
To help advertisers understand how consumers use local search, Google commissioned a study of over 5,000 smartphone users in the U.S. to find relevant tips for local advertisers. If your business has a local presence and you’re looking to drive more customers to your business, consider these four tips for using local search ads to their full potential."

###4. [Social Listening: What Was Trending on Mother's Day?&nbsp;<i class="icon-link"></i>](http://socialmediatoday.com/localspeak/2422586/social-listening-what-was-trending-mother-s-day)
>"The favorite Mother’s Day commercial in social media conversations was the NBA’s “MVP” commercial, which turned NBA star Kevin Durant’s MVP acceptance speech into a humble tribute to his mother. Produced by Goodby, Silverstein & Partners with NBA Entertainment, the “Real MVP Stars” commercial was lauded for its humility and passion, touching on the enduring confidence and strength conveyed by Durant’s mother in her unwavering belief in him against all odds."

How to add **Pause** to your day: 
Matt makes a great point about how using *analogue* tools can help us slow down and think. We all know how writing in a notebook slows us down but makes our writing much tighter. -L

>"There’s a ritualistic quality to these objects, but that’s not why I love them. I use them to slow myself down. To introduce just enough friction that I’m compelled to pause. We don’t pause enough anymore. We don’t give ourselves time to think."
