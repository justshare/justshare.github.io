## The Daily Leaderboard

###1. [13 Reasons to Be Pretty Damn Euphoric You Are a Freelancer&nbsp;<i class="icon-link"></i>](http://www.copyblogger.com/authority-freelancer/)
>"There is a good chance that by 2020 you will be self-employed. 
An old Intuit report estimated that by that time nearly 40 percent of Americans will make their living as temporary workers — that is, as freelancers, business owners, or independent workers. 
This could be good news. 
Those who are not freelancers often look at those who are with a trace of envy. From the cubicle, the grass certainly looks greener. It is the life that you could have. And should have. 
If only. 
According to a 2009 Gallup poll, working for yourself is one of the hardest jobs you’ll ever have: self-employed workers routinely clock over 60 hours a week."

###2.  [Feeling More Antsy and Irritable Lately? Blame Your Smartphone&nbsp;<i class="icon-link"></i>](http://www.motherjones.com/media/2014/06/nicholas-carr-smartphones-turning-us-impatient-irritable-monsters)
>"Back in 2006, a famous study of online retailing found that a large percentage of online shoppers would abandon a retailing site if its pages took four seconds or longer to load. In the years since then, the so-called Four Second Rule has been repealed and replaced by the Quarter of a Second Rule. Studies by companies like Google and Microsoft now find it takes a delay of just 250 milliseconds in page-loading for people to start abandoning a site. "Two hundred fifty milliseconds, either slower or faster, is close to the magic number now for competitive advantage on the Web," a top Microsoft engineer said in 2012. To put that into perspective, it takes about the same amount of time for you to blink an eye."

###3. [An 18-Minute Plan for Managing Your Day And Finding Focus&nbsp;<i class="icon-link"></i>](http://www.farnamstreetblog.com/2014/07/bregman-finding-focus/)
>"We start every day knowing we’re not going to get it all done or fit it all in. How we spend our time is really a function of priorities. That’s why Peter Bregman argues in 18 Minutes: Find Your Focus, Master Distraction, and Get the Right Things Done that we need to plan ahead, “create a to-do list and an ignore list, and use our calendars." 
“The hardest attention to focus,” he writes, “is our own.”"

###5. [4 Tips for Managing Money as a Freelancer&nbsp;<i class="icon-link"></i>](http://www.careermeh.com/2014/06/24/4-tips-managing-money-freelancer/)
>"Of all the practical skills a freelancer of any sort needs — basic HTML, business communications, etc. — managing money is the most important. If you can’t manage your rollercoaster of a freelancer income, you’ll soon find yourself in dire straits or back in a 9-to-5 job."
