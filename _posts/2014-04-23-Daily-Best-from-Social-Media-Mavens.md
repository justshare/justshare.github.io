###1. [Ten Things I Learned Researching Ten of the World’s Fastest Growing Startups&nbsp;<i class="icon-link"></i>](https://medium.com/@morganb/ten-things-i-learned-researching-ten-of-the-worlds-fastest-growing-startups-a53106e2599a)
>"When we launched GrowthHackers.com back in late September we had a notion of doing “growth teardowns” of the fastest growing startups. We wanted to answer the question that everyone on the outside of these rocketships wanted to know the answer to: “How did they grow so fast?” So we set to work doing deep research dives on companies like Uber, Snapchat, Yelp, LinkedIn, HubSpot, Evernote and more. 
By scouring the Web for interviews, videos, past profiles and more, we pulled insight from dozens of sources for each case study. Based on our research we were able to piece together what made these companies so successful—and in the process reverse engineer their growth engine. While we certainly didn’t get everything 100% right, we received overwhelmingly positive feedback that the case studies were some of the most detailed accounts of these companies’ growth engines ever created. 
So now, with ten growth studies under my belt, I want to share ten things I’ve learned from these incredibly successful companies, to hopefully inspire you and shape your thinking when it comes to startup growth."

###2.  [5 Killer Conversion Tactics Straight From Warrior Forum&nbsp;<i class="icon-link"></i>](http://norrth.com/blog/killer-conversion-tactics-straight-warrior-forum/)
>"I have a large amount of respect for the WF *(Warrior Forum)* peddlers because they are exceptional at it. It is the same type of respect for the guys who ripped me off with 3-Card Monty in Times Square when I was a kid. They have, over the years, mastered direct marketing tactics that are either too audacious for most brands to touch or they have just stayed under tight wraps, circulating in the Warrior Forum and on private Facebook Groups. I am going to lay down a few of the Warrior Forum tactics that are effective conversion tactics:"

###3. [The Art of Selling; For Startup Founders&nbsp;<i class="icon-link"></i>](http://kerryfalk.com/the-art-of-selling-for-startup-founders)
>"Like many things in business, selling is hard. Anecdotally, it’s so difficult that most professional sales people that I’ve seen and interacted with do not succeed. As in life, there can be many reasons for their struggles and there is no panacea. I’d like to offer a framework for Startup Founders to use to structure their sales calls that will result in better understanding of their customer, add value to both parties through the discussion, and provide a natural path to closing the deal. 
Again, this is not a panacea. If your market requires long sales cycles, multiple points of contact, in-depth decision criteria, and/or you’re in the midst of product development and want customer involvement, follow The Lean Startup, are actively involved in customer development, this is for you. If you have short selling cycles, each sale is <$10k, and your contact with the customer is brief or non-existent there may be more helpful sales advice out there."

###4. [Lean Referrals – Using NPS Results to Drive Referral Program Decisions&nbsp;<i class="icon-link"></i>](http://www.referralsaasquatch.com/lean-referrals-using-nps-results-to-drive-referral-program-decisions/)
>"For those of you who aren’t familiar with NPS (net promoter score) surveys, this is an age-old technique used by companies to gauge whether a customer would promote the business to a friend or colleague. It looks something like this: 
“On a scale of zero to 10, how likely are you to refer to a friend or colleague?” 
It’s pretty basic, yet wildly powerful at the same time. A NPS survey will unlock a key bit of insight for businesses who are questioning whether they should create a customer referral program. This key learning is “how much do you (the customer) like me (the business)?”"

###5. [PRODUCT STRATEGY MEANS SAYING NO&nbsp;<i class="icon-link"></i>](http://insideintercom.io/product-strategy-means-saying-no/)
>"When your product gets traction, you’ll find yourself inundated with good ideas for features. These will come from your customers, your colleagues, and yourself. Because they’re good ideas, there’ll always be lots of reasons to say yes to them"
