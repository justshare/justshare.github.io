## The Daily Leaderboard

###1. [The Secret To Getting Found On Page 1 of LinkedIn Search&nbsp;<i class="icon-link"></i>](http://topdogsocialmedia.com/social-selling-seo/)
>"When B2B professionals hear that LinkedIn is 277% more effective for lead generation (aka social selling) than Facebook or Twitter, they quickly realize LinkedIn is not a tool that can be ignored.
