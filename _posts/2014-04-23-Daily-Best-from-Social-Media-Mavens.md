## The Daily Leaderboard

***
In the daily best today, we look at some great posts on hashtags. Every now and then people in social media start talking furiously about hashtags, trigger debates on how many to use, how often to use and so on. We are sure many people have researched the Science of the hashtag and told you how to scientifically proceed using hashtags. Yet, it is always good to hear experiences and advice from regular practitioners. So here's a curated list of posts on hashtags. If you have more good posts to recommend, do share them in the comments. 

One more thing - you've probably seen the hashtag videos a number of times already. In fact, every single post on hashtags that we feature today makes a reference to the Jimmy Fallon #hashtag videos. But they are so good! Do a +1 again - for your viewing pleasure - #hashtag video of Jimmy Fallon and Justin Timberlake and #hashtag2 video of Jimmy Fallon and Jonah Hill also feature today!

###1. [3 Ways to Master the Hashtag&nbsp;<i class="icon-link"></i>](http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/233153)
>"The biggest mistake companies make with hashtags is assuming that people want to talk about their dumb brand. Hint: They don't. People want to talk about what matters to them, not what matters to you. While a brand-name hashtag can help lay the groundwork for a conversation (see the #24Fox example), it's generally better for companies to connect with people on social networks by tapping into conversations that are already happening. As my friend Tom Fishburne of Marketoon Studios says: "Brand loyalists are loyal to a brand only as long as a brand complements their own life and priorities.""

###2.  [Your Guide To All Things Hashtag Analytics & Optimization&nbsp;<i class="icon-link"></i>](http://marketingland.com/hashtag-analytics-81205)
>"The present use of hashtags dates back to 1988, when early internet users began including them in messages on the popular chat platform IRC. They were used to group messages, images and videos into categories. 
Hashtags reappeared on Twitter in 2007 when Nate Ritter used the hashtag #sandiegofire at the end of all his tweets to inform people of the wild fires in his area of San Diego, California. 
Since then, many popular social networks such as Facebook, Google+, Instagram and others have adapted hashtags as way to let users more easily communicate."

###3. [Branded Hashtags: The Next Big Thing In Trademarks?&nbsp;<i class="icon-link"></i>](http://www.mondaq.com/unitedstates/x/315862/Trademark/Branded+Hashtags+The+Next+Big+Thing+in+Trademarks)
>"The increased usage of hashtags has lead to a number of new trademark application filings. #TEAMJESUS, #RISETOTHRIVE, and #HELMETSARECOOL are recent examples. One particularly enterprising applicant even tried to obtain federal trademark protection for the word "hashtag" in connection with tv advertising; various electronic transmission and broadcasting services; and entertainment services such as development, distribution and production of programs, contest and incentive award programs for people who contribute to shows and other interactive entertainment programs. The USPTO rejected the application on the grounds that it was merely descriptive of the applicant's services "because it immediately tells consumers that the interactive nature of these services involves the use of hashtags, as that term is widely used by others in the industry." In hashtag parlance, the application was a #fail."
