>"You’ve heard the old saying, “A lie is bad, the truth is the best, but a half-lie is the worst.” The following blog myths have in them some truth. That’s what makes them so spreadable. After all, if it was completely bogus, no one would believe it!"

###2.  [What Type of Agency Will Own Social Media Marketing?&nbsp;<i class="icon-link"></i>](http://www.adweek.com/news/advertising-branding/what-type-agency-will-own-social-media-marketing-157697)
>"Bissell's director of marketing Theresa Junkunc knows how difficult managing social media work can be, particularly when multiple roster shops compete for the same assignment. That's one reason why Bissell this month decided to consolidate its creative and media business at a single shop: Olson. Still, the broader industry question of what type of agency owns social media marketing—traditional creative? digital? public relations? media?—remains. Junkunc reflects on that question, social listening and how she evaluates the effectiveness of social efforts."

###5. [The Beginner’s Guide to Social Media Metrics: Engagement&nbsp;<i class="icon-link"></i>](http://blog.hootsuite.com/beginners-guide-engagement/)

You’re following what’s being said about your industry and brand, your team is trying to produce and share great content, you’re interacting with customers, finding prospects and you’re trying to make sense of it all. The biggest question you’re most likely trying to answer is if your work in social is helping you achieve real business results. To find out, you need to measure your efforts by tracking the right social media metrics."
