###1. [Foster Organic Traffic in a Crowded Internet With These 6 Steps&nbsp;<i class="icon-link"></i>](http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/235978)
>"Groupon deindexed its own site for about six hours to determine how much it affected its traffic. The result? About 60 percent of its direct traffic is actually organic search. 
For new and established businesses alike, organic traffic is a precious resource, and building it can seem insurmountable. Fortunately, there are ways to build organic traffic in a crowded Internet. It starts with digging into your data, working through a meticulous ranking process, and ends with greater readership and a robust and synergistic marketing presence."

###2.  [The Psychology of Anticipation and What it Means for Your Conversion Rates&nbsp;<i class="icon-link"></i>](http://unbounce.com/conversion-rate-optimization/psychology-of-anticipation-conversion-rates/)
>"One area of psychology that affects conversions is anticipation — mentally preparing for and expecting a certain outcome or result. We often refer to a person’s anticipation as being “high” or “low” but what does this actually mean? How does anticipation impact what we do as marketers? 
There are three points about anticipation that I want to explain to you. As you begin to understand the psychological process of anticipation, you’ll become more skilled at implementing techniques that match the psychological needs of users. 
Hang on. I’m going to get a little scientific, but I think you’ll get it."

###3. [How Brands Can Tap into the Organic Reach of their Fans&nbsp;<i class="icon-link"></i>](http://socialtimes.com/brands-organic-reach_b200884)
>"Problem: You can’t really reach your fans anymore. Not without paying, at least. The changes to Facebook’s algorithm means that brands are effectively being charged to access the very fans that they spent so much energy acquiring. Although this phenomenon has been well-documented, solutions remain less clear. The discussion must turn to defining strategies for success in this new reality, and hopefully beyond. 
It’s worth stating upfront that the only immediate answer is to go hat-in-hand to the very Facebook gods that just took away your reach and pay up to get it back, again and again. 
Alternatively, you can begin to cultivate new channels for creating engagement and grabbing attention by tapping into the organic reach of your fans and followers. Simply put, if you can help your fans publish fun, interesting and engaging content that’s relevant to your brand, you will replace the success you once had posting directly on your own Facebook page. 
Success with this strategy relies on understanding what motivates individuals to publish content and then finding ways to trigger those individuals to do just that. The main difference here is that you are no longer looking for content that will engage the audience you reach (i.e. getting them to Like and comment). Instead, you’re looking for ways to get that group to actively share content with their friends and family. It’s a completely different mindset."

###4. [SOS: Save Our (Organic) Social&nbsp;<i class="icon-link"></i>](http://www.portent.com/blog/social-media/sos-save-organic-social.htm)
>"It is not exactly breaking news that brand page organic social efforts are being thwarted by Facebook’s algorithm changes, which are making it harder than ever to get your organic social updates seen by your desired audience. But all hope is not lost! There is a strategy that if implemented correctly can potentially improve your organic reach and help bolster your overall organic social efforts across multiple platforms. This important strategy is simply ensuring that you have the correct social media metadata coded into every piece of content you post. Social metadata is something that you have more than likely seen across your networks, but never really thought about how or why it appears."

###5. [Three Ways to Outperform Your Online Competition&nbsp;<i class="icon-link"></i>](http://www.problogger.net/archives/2014/07/29/three-ways-to-outperform-your-online-competition/)
>"There’s no denying that plenty of us are trying to make a living on the internet. The good news is that it’s still early days when it comes to building a successful online business. In reality, very few businesses know how to effectively execute strategic online marketing campaigns. Now is the perfect time for you to take advantage of this gap in the market and outperform your online competition. With some sound advice, a strategic approach, and a solid implementation plan, your online business performance can go from strength to strength."
