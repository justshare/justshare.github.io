## The Daily Leaderboard

###1. [The Answer to the Organic Reach Vs Advertising Problem on Social Media Channels&nbsp;<i class="icon-link"></i>](http://www.socialmediaexplorer.com/social-media-marketing/the-answer-to-the-organic-reach-vs-advertising-problem-on-social-media-channels/)
>"If you think about it, our employees are already representing our brand in social channels whether we like it or not. Their friends and followers likely know they work for your company. Everything picture they post, every status update they publish and every comment they share is a reflection on your brand. If you are concerned about how that reflects on you, I’ll be the first to say social media isn’t your problem. You have a hiring and culture problem."

###2.  [Facebook Pay-to-Play Model Should be a Wake-up Call to Marketers&nbsp;<i class="icon-link"></i>]( http://socialmediatoday.com/eric-melin/2383986/facebook-pay-play-model-should-be-wake-call-marketers)
>"Dear Facebook
...
How dare you make brands pay for the opportunity to reach millions of targeted users and build a rich community of advocates? Social media is supposed to be free, right?
If brands still believe that, then here’s the first of many wake-up calls: Social media was never free, even before your new “pay to play” model really kicked into high gear. Social media done right takes a lot of strategy, development, trial and error, constant effort, measurement, and customization. In short, social media takes time. And time is never free."

###3. [Why Mobile Ads are seen as a boon to Facebook, But a Plague to Google&nbsp;<i class="icon-link"></i>](http://mashable.com/2014/04/25/facebook-google-mobile-ads/)
>Google's ad business is more more rooted in desktop than Facebook's. While Analysts gave Google has been offering advertising since 2000 and hit upon its current pay-per-click model in 2002, Facebook's history is much shorter. Launched in 2004, Facebook toyed with advertising in its early days, but didn't really embrace a monetization plan until 2009.

###4. [Marketers Not Prepared for Negative Feedback: New Reseach&nbsp;<i class="icon-link"></i>](http://www.socialmediaexaminer.com/negative-feedback-new-research/)
>"When it comes to dealing with negative social buzz, more than half of marketers still aren’t sure what to do.
Research published on eMarketer shows only 45% of marketers currently have an effective strategy to deal with negative social media posts; 23% don’t have any kind of plan; 25% are working on getting a plan; and 8% have a plan that doesn’t work."

###5. [8 Quick Ways You Can Become a Social Media Rockstar&nbsp;<i class="icon-link"></i>](http://www.sr-strategies.com/blog/2014/4/28/8-quick-ways-you-can-become-a-social-media-rock-star)
>"A social media rock star first knows his/her audience.  A country singer isn’t going to smash his guitar after a kick-ass show, and a punk rocker isn’t going to play an acoustic set. They understand who their audience is, and they give them what they want. A true social media rock star knows their audience so well that they know what they like before they do."
