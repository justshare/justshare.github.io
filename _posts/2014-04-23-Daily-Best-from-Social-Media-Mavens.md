###1. [Forget Numbers: 5 Enlightened Ways to Measure Your Brand&nbsp;<i class="icon-link"></i>](http://www.inc.com/curt-hanke/zen-and-the-art-of-branding.html)
>"Brand. It’s a noun. It’s a verb. In theory, it is a universal promise--a declared intention, if you will.

But as an experience, it is complex, diverse, and personal. A brand is one of an organization’s most valuable assets. And yet, its actual value resides in the hearts and minds of its consumers and prospects. (Crazy, huh?)"

###2.  [LinkedIn Publishing: 4 Reasons You Should Want to Do It Now&nbsp;<i class="icon-link"></i>](http://www.business2community.com/linkedin/linkedin-publishing-4-reasons-want-now-0864015)
>"LinkedIn announced recently opening its publishing platforms to members. Up to now, members are only able to share updates and links with their connections within their personal network. LinkedIn turned its sights on content about a year ago and only influencers selected by LinkedIn were given the opportunity to publish articles on the site. With this recent announcement, LinkedIn changes that – they’ll begin to open up their publishing platforms and offer members the ability to publish content to all 227 million LinkedIn members."

###3. [What is Social media listening?&nbsp;<i class="icon-link"></i>](http://www.smartinsights.com/social-media-marketing/social-media-listening/what-is-social-media-listening/)
>"I would argue that in focus groups or using surveys people tend to answer the questions in a way that they wish to be portrayed by their peers. While this may also be said for social (personal branding), the very nature of focus groups and surveys gives users the chance to reflect before saying anything. Social media has a cultural immediacy where users express their opinions en mass and are not prompted by questions that steer answers."

###4. [Yes, Silicon Valley, There Is Such a Thing as Not Enough Bureaucracy&nbsp;<i class="icon-link"></i>](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/01/upshot/yes-silicon-valley-there-is-such-a-thing-as-not-enough-bureaucracy.html?partner=rss&emc=rss&_r=0)
>"The dirtiest word in Silicon Valley is bureaucracy. Tech executives want to move quickly — a Facebook company motto is “move fast and break things” — and layers of bureaucracy, such as human resources departments, are seen as the enemy of speed and efficiency. 
But there is a reason that big, successful companies have layers of bureaucracy — even if they do slow things down. And tech companies are learning that the hard way."

###5. [3 Common Writing Fears & How We Can Overcome Them&nbsp;<i class="icon-link"></i>](http://www.elephantjournal.com/2014/04/3-common-writing-fears-how-we-can-overcome-them/)
>"Fear happens even to experienced writers. (There have been more times than I care to remember when I have sat before the computer and thought, “I can’t write!”)"
