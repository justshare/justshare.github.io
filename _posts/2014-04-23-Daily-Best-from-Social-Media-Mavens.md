## The Daily Leaderboard

###1. [How to Plan Your Tweets For Engagement vs. Site Traffic&nbsp;<i class="icon-link"></i>](http://simplymeasured.com/blog/2014/06/18/how-to-plan-your-tweets-for-engagement-vs-for-site-traffic/)
>"We’ve all heard this. Whether you’re Tweeting in the morning, the afternoon, or the evening, you’re doing it wrong…because everyone has an opinion about the top time to Tweet. 
But that always begs the question…the top time for what? For engagement? For traffic? For both? Most digital marketers understand that different audiences require different tactics, but so many of us struggle with understanding engagement and traffic. 
Earlier this year, Time published an article exploring all the myths we blindly believe about the Internet. One of those myths was that the content we share is the content we read."

###2.  [Creating a Culture for Making Business Social – 5 Tips from Dell’s Connie Bensen&nbsp;<i class="icon-link"></i>](http://3cseo.com/creating-a-culture-for-making-business-social-5-tips-from-dells-connie-bensen-3/)
>"Since people are at the center of any social business, it is critical to provide the necessary training and resources to empower your employees to be successful in social media. While most people today are at least somewhat familiar with social media from a personal perspective, there is a difference between using social networks to keep up with your Aunt Sally's new baby and using the social web to help your company achieve business objectives."

###3. [Does The Power Of Small Batches Apply To Digital Workflows?&nbsp;<i class="icon-link"></i>](http://www.asianefficiency.com/systems/power-small-batches/)
>"I think of batching from two slightly different perspectives: 
Setting aside certain times to do certain tasks, and then grouping those tasks together. If you work in an office, this might mean specific times to respond to emails or calls. If you are a writer, this might mean having certain days reserved for writing. 
Grouping like tasks together and doing them sequentially. I find that when I set aside certain times to do email, I fly through my inbox. I am big on going paperless, so when I scan and process my documents, I batch these tasks together. Doing it this way helps me rip through my stack of documents in the most efficient way, or so I thought"
