###1. [Are You Stuck On The Blogging Hamster Wheel?&nbsp;<i class="icon-link"></i>](http://www.johnpaulaguiar.com/are-you-stuck-on-the-blogging-hamster-wheel/)
>"About 6 months ago I was working a traffic resource that no one was using to drive traffic to their blogs. I worked this resource for 10 months and just recently let it go. Now, I am a persistent guy and will work and idea or project hard till I see results, but the evil flip side is I didn’t know when to cut my losses and run."

>"With Pinterest becoming one of the fastest growing networks, Instagram has matched this with massive growth and high rates of engagement. Instagram was recently reported by Dane Atkinson, CEO of SumAll.com as having as much as 10 times greater engagement than other platforms like Facebook and Twitter. Not bad for a little photo sharing site.  Is it any wonder that Facebook snapped it up for $1 Billion?"
