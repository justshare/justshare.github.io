## The Daily Leaderboard

###1.  [The Best Time to Post On Social Media is...Not Again&nbsp;<i class="icon-link"></i>](http://webquacker.com.au/best-time-post-social-media-is-oh-not-again/)
>"The fallacy at the heart of most arguments over the “best” time to post social media updates is the assumption that what every branded post wants is to be dropped into the ocean during peak traffic times. This assumption ignores the two factors that are really driving your conversion: is your audience online at the time, and can your content outshine the competition?"

###2. [The Psychology of Color in Marketing and Branding&nbsp;<i class="icon-link"></i>](http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/233843)
>"The psychology of color as it relates to persuasion is one of the most interesting--and most controversial--aspects of marketing. 
The reason: Most of today's conversations on colors and persuasion consist of hunches, anecdotal evidence and advertisers blowing smoke about "colors and the mind."   
To alleviate this trend and give proper treatment to a truly fascinating element of human behavior, today we're going to cover a selection of the most reliable research on color theory and persuasion."

###3. [How to Avoid Getting Slaughtered by Penguin 3.0&nbsp;<i class="icon-link"></i>](http://www.quicksprout.com/2014/05/14/how-to-avoid-getting-slaughtered-by-penguin-3-0/)
>"Talking about Penguin is confusing. How many Penguins are there, and which number is the new one? 
Some of the confusion is due to the difference in numbering between Google and some SEOs. Danny Sullivan and those at Search Engine Land chose to use integers to number the Penguin updates. They numbered each update as 1, 2, 3, and 4. 
Matt Cutts, on the other hand, used a decimal numbering system in order to indicate which of the updates were big and which were small. 
Regardless of what numbering system you prefer, there have been four Penguin updates. Two have been big. Two have been small. The fifth Penguin update, not yet a reality, is supposed to be another big one. 
Let me give you a quick history of the Penguin updates, using the more widely accepted numbering system by Google."

###5. [Why You Need a Daily Prioritization Meeting&nbsp;<i class="icon-link"></i>](http://99u.com/articles/22053/why-you-need-a-daily-prioritization-meeting)
>"We live in a culture of urgency, constantly throwing our emotional energy into the latest public scandal, emergency, or cat video. Most of us work in always-switched-on companies where everything feels urgent. Call backs, emails, and meetings are wrought with peak energy. How quickly do you expect a response to an email or changes to a report?"
