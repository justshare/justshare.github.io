## The Daily Leaderboard

###1. [Why It's Time To Re-Think Real-Time&nbsp;<i class="icon-link"></i>](http://darmano.typepad.com/logic_emotion/2014/05/re-thinkreal-time.html)
>"Real-time marketing is indeed a real thing, but we're going to have to stop chasing our own version of the Oreo moment if we're going to make progress in this area. First we have to really get our heads wrapped around the foundation to understand what we're actually trying to do—and what we're trying to do is build brands differently. We essentially have two tools at our disposal: content and engagement. This is where many of us miss the mark. We underestimate how difficult it is to use these tools."

###2.  [The Secret Sauce Of Marketing Analytics: The 5W1H Framework&nbsp;<i class="icon-link"></i>](http://marketingland.com/5w1h-marketing-analytics-5w1h-framework-86043)
>"Today, I am going to reveal my secret sauce for marketing analytics. This simple method is so powerful that anyone can start applying it today to any sort of descriptive analysis, and it will start producing results from day one. 
What’s better, this method does not require any sort of prior knowledge or skill set such as statistics or database querying: anyone from a new grad to the seasoned veteran can use it to get better results. 
The catch? It’s hardly a secret; everyone knows how to do it. In fact, you probably learned it back in primary or secondary school. The method I am talking about is the 5W1H framework."

###3. [USING MOBILE SURVEYS FOR IMMEDIATE CUSTOMER INSIGHTS&nbsp;<i class="icon-link"></i>](http://theengagingbrand.typepad.com/the_engaging_brand_/2014/05/using-mobile-surveys-for-immediate-customer-insights-.html)
>"Fewer and fewer people leave their homes without a smartphone or tablet these days, which means these powerful, familiar computers accompany them down the store aisles, into car dealerships, bed-and-breakfasts, restaurants and events too. A modern, convenient mobile survey, quiz or contest during this experience can feel like a natural part of the experience itself. Without even an app to install, mobile surveys and quizzes use familiar swiping, keyboarding and taking photos that consumers do countless times a day with their mobiles. And deliver once hard-to-collect, in-the-moment insights—in real time."

###4. [8 Facebook Audiences to Help You Make More Sales&nbsp;<i class="icon-link"></i>](http://socialmouths.com/blog/2014/05/13/facebook-audiences/)
>"Likes, comments, engagement… Those are Facebook metrics. At the end of the day, if this doesn’t result on sales, all that is completely useless."

###5. [Snapchat: 5 Reasons Your Brand Might Love It&nbsp;<i class="icon-link"></i>](http://room214.com/mobile/snapchat-5-reasons-your-brand-might-love-it)
>"Despite its newness, some adventurous brands have tapped into Snapchat to cultivate relationships with their up-and-coming fans. Read on to learn what we see as the five core benefits of branding on Snapchat."
