## The Daily Leaderboard

###1. [5 Tips for Managing Social Media in a Big Company&nbsp;<i class="icon-link"></i>](http://www.socialmediaexaminer.com/managing-social-media-big-company/)
>"When there’s no cohesive social media plan, you end up with mixed messages, duplicate accounts, redundant posts and a confused audience. 
The result? The company’s whole social media world crumbles down around you. OK, that may be a little dramatic, but you get the point. 
In a complex organization with many departments (maybe even multiple brands and products), one person simply can’t manage each of those social media accounts. At the same time, those accounts need to have consistency across the board."

###2.  [Who Leads Your Social Activities? Does It Matter?&nbsp;<i class="icon-link"></i>](http://www.socialmediatoday.com/juliewalker/2561966/who-leads-your-social-activities-today-and-does-it-matter)
>"As organisations evolve engagement with customers through social and mobile channels, customers are responding and engaging with both organisations and each other and there are new disciplines emerging across organisations whose role it is to lead and manage these engagements. 
To date, social engagement is generally led by either the marketing or customer service teams and in many large organisations these activities remain in their own silos and this can have an impact on the sentiment and key topics being discussed."

###3. [12 Most Actionable Ways to Work Less&nbsp;<i class="icon-link"></i>](http://12most.com/2014/07/07/12-most-actionable-ways-to-work-less)
>"What would you do with an extra 20 hours a month? Devote more precious time to your family? Get fit to run the marathon you’ve always dreamed of doing? Or maybe you’ll re-invest the time in your business. At an hourly rate of $100, an extra 20 hours per month is worth over $20,000 a year.
Sound enticing? Then let’s get to it!"

###4. [Why You Should Pay for Discovery&nbsp;<i class="icon-link"></i>](http://www.socialmediatoday.com/jebraweb/2562861/why-you-should-pay-discovery)
>"In every web development project, at some point, the designer and the developer disappear into their offices for a period of time and come out with some finished work. During that time, they are creating universes for their client, building web pages out of lines of code and pixels, tailoring everything to the needs of the organization that site will represent. Before they enter that room, they gather information about the client's preferences one way or another. The process of gathering that information is known as discovery, a term taken largely from the legal field, where attorneys spend time before a trial collecting evidence. 
In the context of web and other software development, discovery is often treated as a distinct deliverable. "

###5. [20 Ways to Save HOURS of Social Media Time&nbsp;<i class="icon-link"></i>](http://kimgarst.com/20-ways-to-use-ifitt-to-save-hours-of-social-media-time)
>"IFTTT is an easy-to-use automation tool that allows you to build or select ‘recipes’ for your social media tasks that will save your hours of social media time! Short for ‘If This Then That’, this free platform allows you to specify what you want to happen if certain ‘triggers’ take place. For instance, ‘If I post a link to Facebook, then share it on Twitter’."
