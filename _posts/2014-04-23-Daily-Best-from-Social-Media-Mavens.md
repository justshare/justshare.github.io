## The Daily Leaderboard

###1. [Marketing tech: How to make — or lose — money with marketing automation&nbsp;<i class="icon-link"></i>](http://venturebeat.com/2014/04/23/marketing-tech-how-to-make-or-lose-money-with-marketing-automation/)
>Moving to a marketing automation tool is painful and expensive. You will have to migrate data, get your staff trained, build your processes, set up integration with other software (e.g. CRM systems) and take on the substantial risk that, from the wide range of vendors to choose from, you’ve picked the wrong tool.
So the reality is you start out by losing money.

###2. [11 Ways to Avoid Burnout &nbsp;<i class="icon-link"></i>](http://99u.com/articles/24201/11-ways-to-avoid-burnout)
>Traditional theories teach us that burnout is caused by working too many hours or enduring too much stress, but that’s a gross oversimplification of the matter. Not every person feels overwhelmed at the thought of delving into an inbox 96 new emails deep, and some people actually rely on pressure at work to perform at a high level.
There’s also no one-size-fits-all cure for burnout: Some people reach for junk food when stressed, while others may find themselves unable to sleep properly.

###4. [Tumblr Study Says It Has More Social TV Activity Than Twitter&nbsp;<i class="icon-link"></i>](http://adage.com/article/digital/tumblr-study-social-tv-activity-twitter/292764/)
>Twitter got its ad business off the ground by selling marketers on the premise that its service complements TV, and now it appears that Tumblr is treading a similar path.
The Yahoo-owned blogging platform has commissioned a study by a U.K.-based social-data-intelligence company called Pulsar that says the volume of social-TV activity on Tumblr is actually much greater than on Twitter. That is, when looking at it through an 11-day window that spans from five days before the show airs to five days after.

###5. [All Online Digital Roads Lead to Google+&nbsp;<i class="icon-link"></i>](http://thesocialmediamonthly.com/online-digital-roads-lead-google-plus/)
>Google can’t get any of us to use Google Plus, but they’re still trying. And they’re pushing hard. One of the reasons I love blogging is, for good or evil, I don’t need any evidence for anything I say. With that caveat, Google’s closing in on its goal of being federated across all of its properties, so be acutely aware. They’re triangulating us all and will soon be able to identify not merely what “you” — someone like you, a demographic generality — want, need, and desire, but what you, yourself, (or me, Chris Abraham), want in particular, down to, at most, your person (and the maximum 7.8 square meters around you).
