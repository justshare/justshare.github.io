## The Daily Leaderboard

###1. [Why Community Is Important In Social Media&nbsp;<i class="icon-link"></i>](http://kimgarst.com/why-community-important-social-media)
>"Have you ever noticed how certain fan pages, groups, tweeps, Pinterest boards or pages on Google+ always seem to have a buzz about them? These pages always seem to have a wealth of followers commenting, sharing, talking to each other, asking questions and posting successes.  While on other pages, the energy feels dead, like a ghost town?"

###2.  [Secrets of Great Communities and Community Managers?&nbsp;<i class="icon-link"></i>](http://socialmediatoday.com/vanessa-dimauro/2508551/secrets-great-communities-and-community-managers)
>"The real work begins the day you launch the online community, and not the day you select or launch a tool. Too many organizations launch their communities without a 90 day plan which includes member acquisition, beta group participation, ongoing content and conversation programs, member outreach plans."

###3. [Community Management: The 90-9-1 Rule is Dead&nbsp;<i class="icon-link"></i>](http://www.senseimarketing.com/community-management-the-90-9-1-rule-is-dead/)
>"Applied to social media, the 1% represents those who actively produce content across multiple digital and social channels; the 9% produce and share content as time permits and the 90% are “lurkers,” those who simply read the content produced by others and rarely – if ever – respond, contribute, or share."

###4. [How Community Managers Can Build Lasting Relationships With Fans&nbsp;<i class="icon-link"></i>](http://www.socialmediaexaminer.com/community-managers-build-lasting-relationships/)
>"To have true, consistent engagement, your audience needs to feel like you’re investing in them—not just doing your job. Four ways you can show you’re committed to them (and encourage them to commit to you) are to be vulnerable, generous, interactive and personable. If you can do that, you can take your online relationships from merely friendly to intimate, and eventually, profitable."

###5. [Community and Customer Success Make a Good Mix&nbsp;<i class="icon-link"></i>](http://www.managingcommunities.com/2014/05/29/community-and-customer-success-make-a-good-mix/)
>"“Where marketing grows your customer base, community aides you in keeping those customers by helping them to maximize the use of your product. Yes, those lines are muddied sometimes, yes, marketing helps you keep customers and, yes, there are exceptions that need not be mentioned."
