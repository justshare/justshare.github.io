###1. [Ruining Your Reputation by 'Getting Real' on Social Media&nbsp;<i class="icon-link"></i>](http://www.marketingprofs.com/opinions/2014/25161/ruining-your-reputation-by-getting-real-on-social-media)
>"...recently, I've seen many marketing blogs that suggest that we're approaching consumer engagement in the entirely wrong way. For those bloggers, social media work must truly be social. In other words, the content must feel like it comes from a human being and be somehow authentic and real. 
Companies that engage with consumers in that manner, the thinking goes, will experience astronomical success that eludes others. Some bloggers are going so far as to suggest that CEOs and other executives, under their own names, should communicate with clients directly rather than attempt to speak for a business. 
Let me say upfront that I think this approach can be catastrophic for some companies, as it often leads to really nasty reputation management problems. In fact, I think that getting real isn't at all the right approach for companies that really want to do business in the years ahead. 
And I'll tell you why. "

>"So you're reading up on creating your first landing page, and everything seems like a no-brainer. Great headline? Check. Form that's the proper length? Check. Customized "submit" button? Check, check, check. 
Then you see "trust seals." You stop. You're not sure what that means or if you need to include them on your landing page. 
The other suggestions seem simple -- this one's out of left field. So what do you do? Here's what you need to know about trust seals (sometimes referred to as trust "symbols") before slapping one on your landing page."

Here's a point vs counterpoint piece on Influencer Marketing. Marcy Massura of MSL GROUP thinks IRM is a huge factor in affecting customer purchase considerations and decisions. Need Tagger CEO Vernan Niven's counterpoint is if IRM can really increase leads and close out sales. Read on... -L

>"All hail the power of influencers, right? If one popular person can be your brand’s mouthpiece, then shouldn’t you leverage that asset to boost your marketing campaigns? Marcy Massura, North American Digital Lead for MSLGROUP, thinks so. 
“Every brand, large or small, service, CPG, and beyond, should be moving their efforts to include IRM [influencer relationship marketing] to be a pillar in their communication and marketing plan,” Massura said. “IRM is important not only to affect purchase decision and consideration, but when deployed strategically, it can benefit reputation, employee retention and recruitment, and diffuse crisis.” 
From the glowing online content about influencer marketing blanketing the web to Danny Brown and Sam Fiorella’s much-buzzed about book “Influence Marketing,” almost everyone seems to value the power of IRM. However, almost everyone does not include NeedTagger CEO Vernon Niven."
