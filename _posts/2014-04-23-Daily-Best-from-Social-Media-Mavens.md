>"An enduring complaint I hear from clients and colleagues is that they don’t have time to blog. Although many businesses see the benefits of it content marketing, they struggle with committing the time it takes to create content on a regular basis. 
The reality is that blogging can take a lot of time – especially when you’re just starting out.

###3. [11 Best Practices for More Effective Content Curation&nbsp;<i class="icon-link"></i>](http://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/best-practices-effective-content-curation)
>"Think of social media as akin to driving by a house at 35 miles an hour and trying to throw a newspaper into the mailbox. Sometimes it’ll get in, most of the time it won’t. You’ll need to play the numbers game a bit so that a small percentage of your curated content reaches and impacts your intended audience."

###5. [Influencer Marketing Ideas from Influential Marketers – INFOGRAPHIC&nbsp;<i class="icon-link"></i>](http://feldmancreative.com/2014/05/influencer-marketing-ideas/)
>"Influencer marketing is bleeping big on the radar screen of the i-world because we’re creating exabytes of data faster than we can pause to learn what the hell an exabyte actually is. And, of course, we not just going gangbusters creating content. It gets distributed at the speed of gigahertz in googols (which is 1 followed by 100 zeros). 
Something like that. 
The crux of the matter is this: while everyone’s capable of making ripples, an elite few actually have the power to make waves. They’re influential. Readers care what they think, are more prone to buy into their points of view and act on them."
