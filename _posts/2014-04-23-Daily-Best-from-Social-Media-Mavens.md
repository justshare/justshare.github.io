## The Daily Leaderboard

###1.  [The Productivity and Life Hack That Almost Always Works&nbsp;<i class="icon-link"></i>](http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/233480)

>"In 1924, Floyd Allport, who is commonly considered the founder of social psychology, coined the term "social facilitation." He deepened the studies to cover everything from word association, test taking, fitness and even math.
...
The results were all the same. The presence of other people makes a dramatic positive difference in output.
It's really this simple: If you want to increase your performance and results in a given area, find some people to join you -- or just have them watch you. Ideally, find people who are a tad out of your league."

###2. [The Rise of Mom-preneurs&nbsp;<i class="icon-link"></i>](http://www.learnvest.com/2014/04/the-rise-of-mom-preneurs-123/)

>"According to recent research from American Express OPEN, the number of women-owned businesses increased 59% from 1997 to 2013, compared to the total number of businesses, which increased by 41% during the same period. Last year, there were more than 8.6 million women-owned businesses in the U.S., generating more than $1.3 trillion in revenue.
As NBC reports, many of these women business owners were once employed by large corporations, but found it difficult to continue working once they had children. Instead, they launched their own companies that offer more flexible schedules and job responsibilities to fit the lives of working mothers."

###3. [Bumpy traffic: How big viral publishers stack up against each other&nbsp;<i class="icon-link"></i>](http://digiday.com/publishers/winners-loser-start-emerge-viral-publisher-traffic-race/)

>"Over the past 12 months, six of the most notable viral publisher sites — BuzzFeed, Distractify, Elite Daily, Thought Catalog, Upworthy and Viral Nova — saw unprecedented gains in audience, according to comScore. ( Though, comScore did not start tracking Distractify and Viral Nova until January 2014).
...
The charts suggest that relying on social media referral traffic can be a wildly effective way to build quickly build an audience. But some of those sites saw their traffic fluctuate wildly over the past half-year, showing that the flip-side to successfully using social networks to build an audience is that traffic patters can be quite unreliable."

###5. [The Power Play of Utilizing Social Media APIs&nbsp;<i class="icon-link"></i>](http://socialmediatoday.com/jayson-bowden/2383326/power-play-utilizing-social-media-apis)

>"Social media APIs in particular can be a valuable source for an online business website. Without APIs it would be difficult for your website to link your Facebook page or Twitter account to your website or to integrate your Google Plus account to your blog posts in order to promote your authorship reputation. In like manner you will not be able to use Google Analytics tool in auditing and optimizing your ecommerce site for better search performance. The social media marketing tools that are used in promoting businesses are powered and supported by APIs. Whether you are using different social media platforms like YouTube, Pinterest, Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn or Foursquare in promoting your businesses, the API is the working force behind the process of exchanging application features and services between your website to a particular social media network."
