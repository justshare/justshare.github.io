## The Daily Leaderboard

###1.  [Real growth hacking is really about communication hacking&nbsp;<i class="icon-link"></i>](http://thenextweb.com/socialmedia/2014/04/29/real-growth-hacking-really-communication-hacking/?utm_source=social&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=profeed)
>"...if you don’t get a closer read on how people engage with your product, or create strategies for engaging with them, you miss opportunities to better communicate your product – and worse, miss the chance to communicate with your user base, and enlist them as your growth allies."

###2. [How to Turn Your Socially Engaged Employees Into Brand Advocates&nbsp;<i class="icon-link"></i>](http://www.business2community.com/social-media/turn-socially-engaged-employees-brand-advocates-0857508)
>"While the Mad Men-era advertising agency brings back some of those romantic feelings for print ads, snazzy taglines and retro imagery, the modern consumer is looking for a more genuine way to fall in love with your product. Your advertising and marketing may accurately describe what your product can do, but in the age of social media, consumers are more likely to trust what other people say about your brand."

###3. [New Report Findings: 5 Crucial Takeaways for Mobile Video Marketers&nbsp;<i class="icon-link"></i>](http://www.business2community.com/video-marketing/new-report-findings-5-crucial-takeaways-mobile-video-marketers-0863844)
>"Because people spend 80% of their time on mobile devices in apps, marketers are justified in serving a majority of their ads through this channel. Not only are people spending more time in apps, but they are also engaging with in-app ads—MediaBrix found that in-app ads can yield 20% engagement and a 2,000% higher click-through rate."

###4. [Will Google Kill Email Marketing?&nbsp;<i class="icon-link"></i>](http://www.business2community.com/email-marketing/will-google-kill-email-marketing-0857715)
>"Google recently rolled out their new Gmail Sponsored Promotions (GSPs) to all Gmail users. In the past, your Gmail inbox was surrounded by ads that companies could manage through AdWords managed placements. But now, the GSP ad shows up at the top of the Promotions tab, looking just like an email, but highlighted to stand out.
That means that not only are your marketing emails separated from the main inbox, they will never show up at the top of that tab."

###5. [Facing Tomorrow With Confidence: Workplace Skills For The Future&nbsp;<i class="icon-link"></i>](http://blogs.sap.com/innovation/human-resources/facing-tomorrow-confidence-workplace-skills-future-2-01249707)
>"The march of automation, outsourcing, and global expansion continues, and new transformations are on the horizon: the “smart revolution” is only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the future interconnectivity of our lives. Every day, the drive towards true innovation becomes more urgent and more complex. Creativity, critical thought and quality communication have always been important factors in employability, but if you want to stay on top, you’ll need to develop these skills in unfamiliar directions.
