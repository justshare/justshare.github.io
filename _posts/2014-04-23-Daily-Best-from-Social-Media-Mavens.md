The era has come when you are supposed to write even the technical manuals and guides in a simple and conversational manner. By doing so, you can generate content which is more appealing and engaging for your readers."

###3.[How to Sell Your Social Media Experience on Your Resume&nbsp;<i class="icon-link"></i>](http://www.social-hire.com/career--interview-advice/4495/how-to-sell-your-social-media-experience-on-your-resume)
>"Almost everyone is on social media nowadays, but just because you use social media for fun, doesn’t mean you’re an expert and know how to use social media while on the job. In other words, personal social media experience doesn’t equate to professional experience, and your resume needs to highlight that professional experience more than anything. Or, at the very least, it needs to address how your personal experiences can inform the job at hand. The question stands: How do you go about doing that?"

###5. [The 3 Most Important Traits of a Great Social Agent for Your Business&nbsp;<i class="icon-link"></i>](http://www.convinceandconvert.com/social-business/the-3-most-important-traits-of-a-great-social-agent-for-your-business/)
>"There are two kinds of people in digital networking: social agents and prospects. 
Everyone in sales knows what a prospect is, but what is a social agent? Who are yours? And what role do social agents play in your social selling strategy? 
Social agents grow your business by sharing your content online to amplify your message. 
While they may never do business with you, they do business for you by recommending you to others. Social agents are equally as important to business growth as prospects, and the biggest mistake salespeople make is undervaluing them."
