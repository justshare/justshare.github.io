>"When you’re writing web page content, blog posts, ad copy, or call-to-action text, this concept of influence and motivation should affect how you write your content.

###3. [Niche Marketing Best Practices: Achieving Targeted Profitability&nbsp;<i class="icon-link"></i>](http://www.inc.com/growthreport/niche-marketing-best-practices-achieving-targeted-profitability.html)
>"It’s possible that your company’s growth trajectory would benefit from narrowing, rather than expanding, your business focus. When managed strategically, niche marketing can empower you to unlock increased profitability by targeting the market segments that are best aligned with your company’s core strengths, corporate culture, and long-term objectives. By adopting best practices in niche marketing, you optimize your company’s capacity to sustain peak performance in the areas most likely to attract and sustain profitable client relationships."

###5. [Is Facebook Still Cool? And for Marketers, Does It Matter?&nbsp;<i class="icon-link"></i>](http://www.marketingprofs.com/articles/2014/25469/is-facebook-still-cool-and-for-marketers-does-it-matter)
>"Dan Miller, a professor of material culture at University College London, caused quite a stir at the end of 2013 when he said Facebook was "basically dead and buried" for 16-18-year-olds in the UK. So when we recently facilitated a series of focus groups in the US with 16-30-year-old males on the topic of their social media habits, we were interested to see how they would respond to "Is Facebook still cool?" 
Almost universally, participants responded with a "No." But does Facebook need to be cool to be valuable to marketers? And if Facebook is no longer cool, how should that change the way marketers think about the channel? 
For Facebook, not being cool is uniquely different from not being useful."
