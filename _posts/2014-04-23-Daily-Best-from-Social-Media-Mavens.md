###2.  [Inbound Marketing vs. Outbound Marketing: Magnet vs. Megaphone&nbsp;<i class="icon-link"></i>](http://www.artillerymarketing.com/blog/bid/198109/inbound-marketing-vs-outbound-marketing-magnet-vs-megaphone)
>"There’s a perception of inbound marketing that it is at odds with outbound marketing: That companies who adopt inbound marketing won’t have to do to outbound marketing. Nothing could be further from the truth. 
It brings to mind the notion of a kitchen freezer and a microwave. They’re very different appliances. But they work beautifully together."

###4. [6 Tools for Gathering Insight from Digital Customer Interactions&nbsp;<i class="icon-link"></i>](http://streetfightmag.com/2014/05/28/6-tools-for-gathering-insight-from-digital-customer-interactions/)
>"According to a 2014 survey by Yodle, half of SMBs think it’s “important” or “very important” for their business to receive positive online reviews, however 68% of those merchants don’t spend any time monitoring what customers are saying about their businesses on the web. 
A lack of time and knowledge are two factors that explain why business owners don’t take a more active role in monitoring how they’re perceived online. However, a number of hyperlocal platforms are now aiming to streamline that process by giving small businesses access to advanced marketing automation tools and analytics suites that were once reserved for national brands and agencies. These platforms give SMBs ways to recognize and analyze mentions of their businesses online, and provide detailed insights into how online customer interactions might be influencing offline sales."
