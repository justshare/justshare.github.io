## Hello Reginald


Reginald Chan is a bright young social media marketers in his late 20's living in Malaysia. He started blogging back in '05 and then everything changed when he started to get his adsense earning. In around 2008/09, he decided to dive even deeper, getting into specific areas of focus in marketing and a little bit of psychology in blogging.

### The Entrepreneur

Reginald decided to leverage his decade long experience in the space to launch a new venture of his own.  He became an entrepreneur, starting his small agency last year. They call themselves consultants as in Malaysia, and consulting is a very niche market. They help small businesses with limited funds to grow or startup. Their major focus is in SEO and digital marketing. The local market is a little slow since it's largely dominated by bigger companies. Also, business owners tend to be a little old school and are still being educated about the benefits of integrating social media into their campaigns.

Although they are based in Malaysia, most of their clients are overseas and are spread across Singapore, Australia and US.

Reginald has a day job as a head of department for an international chain hotel. He loves his day job, but is just as passionate about his consultancy, and squeezes the most out of every day.

### Working with Clients

Most of his clients come in through word of mouth referrals via his network. He then follows up with them via email and with a sales pitch, but his main focus is on delivering outstanding services. *Good services go a long way in keeping customers happy, and bringing in new ones.*

One of his challenges working with clients is in getting them to understand that website ranking and SEO *takes time*. Clients often want the changes to happen immediately, but the cumulative result of Google's indexing, building authorship, and traffic starting to come in takes longer. And finally, conversion may not happen for a number of reasons, which may not necessarily reflect on RoI of the social marketing campaign.

## Productivity Weapons

Since he juggles a ton of things, Reginald leverages productivity tools to stay organized. Evernote + Any.do are his weapons of choice. He spends time during his weekends and evenings in planning out his activities.

He currently uses a combination of Buffer and HootSuite (with his leanings being more towards HootSuite). He has been able to drive "*insane traffic*" to his blogs by leveraging them well.

### Buffer vs Hootsuite

We featured both Buffer and Hootsuite earlier in our post on [10 Social Media Marketing Tools Every Startup Should Consider](http://blog.justshareapp.com/10-best-startup-tools-for-social-media-marketing/).

Reginald loves the scheduling features of Buffer. It is easier to schedule tons of posts using Bulk Buffer. Combined with Followerwonk, it lets him ensure posts are going out when his users are online.  

However, Hootsuite is indispensable. Reginald uses HootSuite for management and monitoring. He sync multiple tabs for followers, business, and social. He also uses Hootsuite for all image posts, which arent convenient using Bulk Buffer. He primarily uses their website apps with Firefox, but also uses the mobile apps on the go, and rarely uses their extensions.


He typically manages around 12 social media accounts, which is the limit of the Buffer paid plan. But he also has too many groups and communities he participates in. Anything extra goes into the business plan which costs more than HootSuite. He feels that's a huge downside for Buffer, but loves that they have a cool team that's very polite and offers top notch service with fast replies within 2 hours. So HootSuite is great since he syncs his top 50 accounts and communities on HootSuite. He'd ideally like to see a higher limit of around 30 profiles, but that could be higher if his business grows.

## Key Success Factors

His key factors that enable social media success would be a mix of *curiosity + content + outreach*. In other words:

* content curation,
* how content gets shared (title of post, hash tags),
*  outreach to influencers.

He finds that curiosity works great at times.  Sometime, having a post like "*Did you know that these are the top 10 things you shouldn't do at work*" gets more hit than anything else. Through his experience, negative words work better than positive, likely an insight into human psychology. In terms of content, he believes in the old school fundaments. *Better content = more shares*.

Outreach is all about getting influencers to retweet and share for you. This is incredibly powerful in his experience, and goes a long way. So *cultivating* those relationships, and channeling the power of influences is a key part of his strategy.

I'd then asked Reginald to call out a few social media marketers whose advice and insights he has respect for, and whom it might be useful for JustShare to feature next. On his list were: Adam Connell of BloggingWizard, Adrienne Smith of AdrienneSmith.net, and John Paul Aguiar of johnpaulaguiar.com. Look out for follow on posts with our discussions with them!
