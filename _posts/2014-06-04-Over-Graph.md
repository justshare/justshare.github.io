##Overview
Following up on our [Getting Started with Social Media Monitoring post](http://blog.justshareapp.com/Getting-Started-with-Social-Media-Monitoring/), we look at a number of products, starting with [Over-Graph](www.over-graph.com). 

A relatively recent entrant to the Social Media Management tools game, Over-Graph claims to be a leading solution in France. Over-Graph is developed by 909c, a France based Social Media and related technologies strategy company, based on their learning and needs garnered from working with multiple large companies.

Simply put, **Over-Graph is targeted at Community Managers, allowing them to manage their brand social profiles**.  You can publish, monitor, respond to and analyze your social profiles.

Before we dive into the functionality in more detail, lets look at the evolution of Over-Graph over a period of time.

##Evolution
With assistance from resources such as [archive.today](http://archive.today) and [screenshots.com](http://www.screenshots.com) we tried to piece together the evolution from a few screenshots. Do note this is not necessarily all changes. However, it does provide some insight into the product and is generally useful information to have.

For Over-Graph we could find just two relevant screenshots, the first from November 2013 and the other that is the more current. It does appear their initial launches were sometime in mid 2013, so there is not much history available anyways.

The screenshot from March 2014 is more or less similar to what is available today.  The main evolution here appears to be a more crisp focus on Community managers in their messaging that developed from December to March to today. The product also seems more fleshed out and they have had a number of customers added.

##Navigation and Usability
Logging in with your Facebook account takes you to the homeboard – A dashboard with some basic stats (or Badges) of your connected Social Profiles.

The Top Navigation control contains tabs that take you between the Publish, Respond and Analyze functions.  At the top right corner you can access your profile and settings.   The right corner has “Collections” which allow you to connect and group your social profiles, a very interesting and useful concept that will be explored further below. Finally on the right side you have slide out easy navigation to some key areas such as the “Tour”, “Draft”, “Scheduled” and to provide “Feedback”.

A reasonably simple and usable navigation structure in the homeboard, this carries through across the product.  There are certain areas that are a little harder to find or figure out such as how to configure collections, but the tour option does a pretty spectacular job of helping you figure it out.

Overall, it offers a decent experience for the most part and is supported quite well by the “tour” option in cases where it is hard to figure out without assistance.

##Functional Highlights
The very first thing you should do is to connect your social profiles and setup collections.  Initially (and without taking any assistance from the tour), we found it just a little confusing. However, as we developed understanding of Over-Graph and started to use it, we found collections to be a very handy concept that not many others offer.  

You start by going and adding all the Social Profiles (it supports Facebook, Twitter and YouTube) you want to manage. If you are managing multiple brands, go ahead and add all your brand accounts.  It splits the connected Social Media accounts into various objects, for example, each Facebook app or page is available as an individual object for each account.  Now you can group specific objects into “collections” so that you can manage them separately. 

For example if you had two brands with their separate twitter accounts and Facebook pages, you can create two collections to manage them separately, You can even have the same underlying Facebook account managing the brands’ Facebook pages, but split them into separate collections. Pretty cool!

**Homeboard** – The homeboard is just a brief view of aggregations of your connected social profiles, displayed as badges – with changes since the last time you connected highlighted.  Currently it shows your Facebook Fans, Twitter –Retweets and Twitter Followers.  Nice looking, but not really as useful.

**Publish** – The publishing interface allows you to post to multiple profiles and/or schedule for posts for later.  Using your selection of a collection, it provides a list of social profile objects that you can simultaneously create posts for.  

What’s really nice about their publishing interface is the ability to create multiple types of posts – see the image below. Also they have multiple options especially on Facebook such as gating a post to a specific audience, country etc.  Using the over-publisher option will simultaneously tweak them for your Facebook versus twitter profiles. You can also save your drafts and look at the draft/schedule from any other screen quickly.

On the Flip side, They do not have an automatic posting option (i.e automatically queuing up messages on a fixed predefined schedule -  you will manually have to select the date/time for each set of posts) that some of the other major publishing software offer.  

**Respond** – This one had us totally confused! Initially, we expected to see the tweets we had published and be able to respond to them.  Unfortunately they do not have a “Tour” option yet for this. A pity since it seems to hold much promise.

Eventually, we figured out this was a monitoring functionality with the ability to view conversations and filter them via a number of criteria. Overall, it seems solid, unfortunately since it wouldn’t generate any data for our connected profiles, we could not explore it any further.  We love the kind of dashboard a SocialBuzz offers for example, and from what we could see this did not seem anywhere near there yet.

**Analyze** – First impressions are “Wow” on this one. Nice graphical widgets with superb graphs cover most engagement and reach metrics by collection.  You can also select time period to see historic performance.  The engagement metrics include overall ones such as PTA (people talking about)/Page post impressions /Twitter impressions etc. with details on engagement by posts, by day etc. Reach metrics include fans, followers, growth/retention/loss of followers/fans.  While most of the Facebook metrics are well covered by the Facebook Insights, the ability to aggregate and present in one view is useful here.  

Analyze is currently in Beta so some of the functionality may not be working or fully accurate.  It is also relatively slow to load, but we expect there is a fair bit of data collection, computation and rendering going on behind the scenes - and the wait maybe worth it.

In addition to the above features, they also appear to have indications of an ability to link accounts into teams, manage workflow while publishing, views across teams while responding/monitoring etc. This was not available yet in this version. If and when available, this should be extremely handy for agencies.

Do also note that some of the above views are from our limited experience, so there may be a few things we have missed out or misinterpreted. **Currently Over-Graph is Free to use**. There are no mobile apps yet.

##Conclusion
As a Social Media Monitoring and Publishing tool, Over-Graph is interesting but still work in progress at this stage. There are a few areas where it does have a wow factor, but equally others that are still evolving.  

Having said that, If you find the idea of grouping Social Profiles and Social Profile objects such as pages/groups etc into entities that you can monitor and manage separately you should check it out. Especially now, while it is free it is a good time to extensively explore it.  It has the added plus of doing some decent publishing although it does not have the auto-queuing feature.
