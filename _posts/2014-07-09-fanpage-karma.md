##Overview

</figure>

We first looked at [*fanpage karma*] (http://www.fanpagekarma.com) when we described our methodology for social media monitoring -  [Getting Started with Social Media Monitoring]( http://blog.justshareapp.com/Getting-Started-with-Social-Media-Monitoring/). In this post we take you through a more detailed review. 

*fanpage karma* is targeted at Social Media Managers, helping them with analyzing and getting more out of the Social Profiles they manage. It supports a variety of the most popular networks and allows you to analyze both your profiles as well as those of your competitors. There is a also a Social Monitoring element that has been recently added that widens the scope of *fanpage karma* from just analytics to social media listening. 

##Evolution
With assistance from resources such as [archive.today](http://archive.today) and [screenshots.com](http://www.screenshots.com), we piece together the evolution from a few screenshots. Do note this is not necessarily all changes and certainly not 100% reliable. However, it does provide some insights into the product and is generally useful information to have.

From the available screenshots as far back as 2012, it is quite remarkable to see how *fanpage karma* has progressed.  The initial iterations around April 2012 was largely facebook focused with a concept of a “Karma” score as a central theme. By June 2012, a number of analytics were added such as types of posts, top users and alerts. It was all free and included unlimited watch lists of Facebook pages.  By July 2012,  *fanpage karma* added deeper richer analytics and the home page started to reflect what it would look like in 2014. They started their first Pro/Paid versions. Initial pricing was at €49.90 for Pro version and €99.90 version that included additional analytics and consulting hours.

By the end of 2012, they added in Twitter analytics and support for multiple users per account. The plans started to change to reflect that with a Premium version at €99 that included Twitter analytics and business version at $149/user/month (with consulting time). The Free versions were now limited to just one Free Fan page.

By Mid 2013, analytics started to include YouTube pages. The higher end plans started to have a whitelabeling option with individual URLs. 
In 2014, Social Monitoring was added as a included as well as separate product with pricing starting at €9.90. Google+ Support was added specifically for monitoring. More on the latest price and plans as we continue our review below.

*Disclaimer: The above is gathered from reviewing web archives. The timelines, changes and the reasons for change may be inaccurate and are only our attempt to guess the evolution of the product*.

##Navigation and Usability
Sign in with your Facebook account and you will be greeted with an animated guide that walks you through setting up your analytics, step by step. Subsequently, you still have prompts that effectively allow you to work your way through the product – for example, it points you to where you can search and load a page to your dashboard.

Layout wise, *fanpage karma* has a lot going on. There are four tabs on the top that allow you to browse through various high level categories such as Dashboard, Insights or Monitoring. Under each category, you have a small summary dashboard followed by detailed analytics presented again as tabs. While there is nothing spectacular about the navigation, it is simple, intuitive and presents a high degree of information density that lends itself well for most users.  The analytics themselves are presented in a number of different graphical charts and for the most part perform well in terms of load times as well as presentation.

##Functional Highlights
Once you have logged in, it is very easy to add in your Facebook fan pages or Twitter profiles. In fact, the search functionality is simply superb and you do not need to remember the ID of the page or the exact name.  Enter in a search term and it will find all relevant pages for you to select and add the right one.

We look at the four high level tabs in depth next: Dashboard and Performance, Insights, Monitoring and Tagging.

###Dashboard and Performance
You usually land in the Dashboard and Performance tab. You can select one or more social items (facebook Fan Pages, Twitter Profiles and YouTube accounts) to start your dashboard with. This provides you a comparison at both a dashboard level and deeper analysis level across these social items.

<br/>
<figure>
<img src="http://cdn.justshareapp.com/DashboardStartFbComp1.jpg"/>

</figure>

You have a number of tabs to explore deeper analytics including comparisons across your social items.
- Performance: This sub-tab, provides you with a number of performance reports of these social items including comparisons across all items in your dashboard. The Free version however allows you access only to the "Number of Fans" and "Talking About" reports. Also, while the “Percentage increase since starting point” report is marked as pro only, it seems to be currently available freely. See image below for more details on the list of reports.

- KPI Matrix: These metrics allow you to map the same performance factors on a X/Y axis. Once again, only "Number of fans" and "Talking about" are currently free with the rest available in the paid versions.

- MarketShare: This sub-tab provides pie and bar chart representations of the same performance metrics.

- Times & Types, Post History and Post Content sub-tabs are available only with *fanpage karma* paid accounts. They appear to offer deeper insights into posts, topics, hashtags etc. and seem to be fairly interesting.  Do note that some of the data from here is actually available in the Free Plan under the insights tab covered next though!

- Tagging: This feature appears to provide some interesting insights into tags for posts made. However, this is available only with *fanpage karma* business. 

Notes:
A.  Multiple Dashboards are available only with Paid Accounts.
B. YouTube dashboards and analytics are very limited currently for example to just the performance sub-tab.
C. Twitter Profiles show only Post Content, Times & Types and History sub-tabs. The Post Content sub-tab for Twitter is interesting and includes Frequency, Interactions, Top posts, Pictures, Top links, Hashtags, words and users mentioned. Interestingly this is available free for the Twitter Profile whereas it is available only in the pad versions for Facebook fan pages. Times & Types is similar to the dashboard for Facebook fan Pages.
D. Quirk - in the Free version if you select even one FB page, then you cannot select a Twitter or Youtube Profile even if you delete the FB pages from your Dashboard!

###Insights
This tab offers deeper insights into each Social Item and also allows comparisons across them. Do note that you will get near complete insights only for one Fan Page in the free plan (click on the "activate" link against one of the KPIs to do that.)

- Content: Provides you with insights on Posts, including reactions, top/weakest posts (likes/comments), most frequent words, hashtags, sources, length of posts to reactions. The amount and depth of analysis is quite good here.

- Times & Types: Shows posts per day with some analysis and comments. For example below you can see Callaway Golf fan page seems to prefer Friday to make its posts, but is more successful on another day. The engagement per daytime report then highlights that thursday and saturday actually have higher engagement! 
Analysis is also available on types of posts and engagement/success by post type.

- Influencers: This sub-tab tab offers insights into top influencers, what they are posting, top countries and also origin of fans. There are some interesting insights such as comparable pages with similar fans. For example, it listed TaylorMade golf and golf channel as comparable pages to Callaway golf, which is bang on.

- Fan Posts: This sub-tab helps you gauge the number of fan posts and how many posts they reacted to.

- Ad Value: This is available only in premium plans, but looks like it does some computation of how much each post would have otherwise cost if a paid advertisement was run in terms of views.

- History and Benchmarking: This sub-tab provides a comparison of performance of this page against other pages with similar number of fans. Some of the benchmarking such as the engagement benchmarking/PPI benchmarking is probably not as useful since it compares against all categories of fan pages (and not just fan pages in the category of the one you are analyzing). It is easier to use the dashboard or insights and select your own comparisons against competition for more relevant data.

For Twitter Insights - Content, Times & Types, History and Influencers are available. While the Content, Times & Types and History are the same as in the Dashboard page, for Influencers you will need to be the owner of the Twitter profile. 

Note: 
A. Influencers could take a few hours to fetch data.
B. Dashboard/Insights are available for Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.

###Monitoring
Monitoring is available for Facebook, Twitter and Google+ and provides you with Social Listening/Monitoring features. This is separate from the Analytics sections (Dashboards/Insights), although some level of analytics are available here (and use the core performance metrics data available in the analytics sections). You start by adding keywords from various social media channels to kickstart your monitoring. Do note that only one keyword is allowed for the Free version. 

<br/>
<figure>
<img src="http://cdn.justshareapp.com/MonitoringAddKeyword1.png"/>

- Monitoring: This sub-tab shows basic stats as well as some interesting detailed analysis such as Tweets/Posts, Sentiments, Top posts, Top Links, Top Pics, Top users by activity, interaction, fame (followers). Top Hashtags, Top Words, Top mentions (of users).  You can also search all posts in the time period set for any words, hashtags or profiles.

<br/>
<figure>

This is comparable to some of the good monitoring software available out there and covered earlier here - [5 Great Free Tools For Social Listening] (http://blog.justshareapp.com/5-Great-Free-Tools-For-Social-Listening/). 

The basic monitoring as well as analysis under this tab are similar for Facebook/Twitter/Google +, although weirdly the reports terminology refers to posts as "Tweets" irrespective of the social network!

- Morning Reports: You can configure to receive daily email summary of your fan pages from here. 
- Post Alerts: You can configure notifications via email whenever any new post shows up on your page/profile. 
- Shitstorm Alert: You can configure an alert based on whenever a post receives some exceptional amount of reactions. The threshold that defines “exception amount” is also configurable. 

Note: 
A. The Morning Report, Shitstorm Alert and Post Alerts appear to be available only for Facebook (and not Twitter/Google + although the Live monitoring tab supports all 3).
B. The Free version is available for only unto a 100 mentions a month and just one keyword, so this may not be useful in its free avatar.

###Tagging
This feature is available only with the business plan and seems to be a recurring theme under Dashboard, Insights as well as in its own top-level tab.

##Pricing
Pricing for Analytics (which includes monitoring) starts at  €49.90/month upto €149.90 for Business. See the chart below. Higher plans get twitter analytics, shared dashboards, larger archive and direct contact with experts. 

Social Monitoring starts at €9.90 per month unto €199.90 per month. Higher plans get more users, search terms, mentions and archive. 

<br/>

<figcaption>Pricing</figcaption>
</figure>

So how competitive is the pricing? It is increasingly hard to do apples to apples comparisons since various analytics software offer other features as well. For example SimplyMeasured, which starts at $500/mo both packs a punch with the analytics and has wider social network coverage. AgoraPulse starts at just $29 but seems to have less depth than *fanpage karma* and also has more restrictions on accounts etc. 

On the Social Monitoring/Listening side, the main advantage *fanpage karma* has is the analytics tied to it. Once again it is hard to do a fair comparison for example with Hootsuite's free/$8.99 plan (which also has post scheduling, but not the same level of analytics). Socialbuzz is free and yet offers a reasonable amount of analytics, while its social listening dashboard is pretty well presented. Also Hootsuite's free plan allows you to do a reasonable amount of monitoring versus the free version of *fanpage karma*.

Overall, it does look reasonable especially for what it provides.

##Conclusion
Bringing to a conclusion this detailed review on *fanpage karma* is hard. However a few points that are somewhat conclusive: 
- From its inception fanpage karma has been adding significant value to its offering consistently. So as a subscriber you could expect to receive incremental value over time.
- There is fantastic coverage of analytics for Facebook and Twitter. The recent additions of Youtube and Google+ show good intent to widen this to other social networks.
- There is some redundancy in the functionality as you browse the various high level tabs. But the slide and dice of data and presentation of analytics still offers some differentiation and is useful.
- While the Free plan is somewhat useful for analysis of a single social item (Facebook Fan page or Twitter Profile), it is very limited especially when it comes to Social Monitoring.
- Pricing seems to be reasonable overall, especially for the analytics sections.
