###Why Share?  

Two thousand years ago, humans lived in solitary tents from which they stepped out only when they needed food. They hardly ever met or interacted with other people. Believe it? I thought not.

Humans are [wired to share](http://www.ted.com/talks/rachel_botsman_the_case_for_collaborative_consumption) says [Rachel Botsman](http://www.rachelbotsman.com/), pioneer of the term [*collaborative consumption*](http://www.amazon.com/Whats-Mine-Yours-Collaborative-Consumption/dp/0061963542) that encapsulates the interactions in a sharing economy. If you put a bunch of people together someplace, then they are going to start sharing something pretty soon.Technology has enabled the reach of that sharing to get wider.


###What to Share?

What to share is hampered only by our imagination and perhaps legalities! But let us look at what people usually share in the connected world that we live in.

* Share what we know  
   If you are competent in something, it is a very fulfilling act to share your knowledge with other people. How often have we heard of things being done for the *sheer joy of it*.  

* Share to know  
   Oftentimes sharing can become a means to learn something new or to enhance your knowledge of a subject. When one reads a good piece of work, sharing it spreads the work to other similarly interested people. It also helps you connect to people with shared interests. A good network of connections seeds a lot of good opportunities for growth. Nobody need tell us how motivating a sense of having our passions being understood feels like!

* Share to be known  
 The nature of work has been changing dramatically in the last couple of decades again thanks to technology. [Portfolio Careers](http://www.forbes.com/sites/victoriastefanakos/2013/06/14/why-i-love-having-a-portfolio-career-and-you-could-too/) will become mainstream very soon. So we need to be efficient managers of our portfolios.  Online presence and credibility become crucial both to personal growth and viability.

 Why do you think we share?
