#It all started one fine day...

A few weeks back, we saw something very interesting. One weekend,  a product we experimented with but had dropped further investments in started to acquire a lot of users. Our website started to get a gazillion hits. This sudden spike stayed unexplained for a couple of days, until we traced it back to a blog written by my good friend and JustShare colleague/co-founder Arvi here ["What we learned from a Failed MVP".](arg0s.in/what-we-learnt-from-a-failed-mvp.html)

Now if you look through Arvi's blog, he has many fine blog posts. All of which follow what I'd like to think is the "science" of good blogging. Much of this science can be found in this really neat infographic post from copyblogger here  - [11 Essential Ingredients Every Blog Post Needs] (http://www.copyblogger.com/ingredients)

#With wildfire
While many of the posts did see good response, none of them turned into wildfire like this one. It created a bunch of results that we would die to have while blogging for content marketing. Shares, Retweets, Engagement on the blog post, Huge Spike in traffic to our website, Huge interest and acquisition of customers (unfortunately to a defunct product) and so on.

#And Triggered Off
So this set me thinking on what makes a *good* post *great*. I polled a few of my colleagues at JustShare for some of their all time favorite posts and credit to them for identifying a few that helped me illustrate some of the points. 

All I could see were no real rules or guidelines. And therefore the **"Unscience"** of blogging.

# My Two Cents
Here are a few things I came up with that seem to be consistent across great blog posts

##1. Creating Intrigue.

 A good topic and a good catchy title are part of the commandments of a good blog, they are just basic requirements. Some elements of Intrigue could include: something New - You saw it here first!; something counter-intuitive - "Global Warming is not bad"  ok, I made that one up, but who knows! ; Or best of all something controversial.

A great blog has some element of controversy in it to generate Intrigue. Not necessarily bad controversy, but just controversial to current thinking or current behavior. 

When Arvi touched upon "failure" in his highly popular blog post,  it generated a controversial behavior to current thinking where we are usually used to hearing "success" stories.

There is this writeup from a long time back, probably before the term blogging got popular. (Thanks to Arvi for pointing [this](http://www.hindu.com/fline/fl1516/15160040.htm) one out). The author has passionately touched upon a nationally controversial topic in a way that is really powerful. While I did not agree with the overall stance in this one, it had me peeping on the other side of the fence for a while.

##2. Belief and Passion trumps pure logic.  

More often than not we search for some strong logic, analytics or data driven approach to show case our thoughts. But nothing, I repeat, nothing captivates an audience like belief and passion. It doesn't matter if you can poke holes at the logic, but if the post cries out with strong belief it can push towards greatness. A lot of great success stories seem to have this near picture perfect insightful data analysis driven approach. In reality it was just strong gut feel that was then post processed to show great insight once success came by. Back your gut. Even if you don't have data today.

An example of strong belief is in [this one] (http://www.paulgraham.com/love.html) suggested by JustShare colleague and prolific blogger Lavanya.  While the post does not tick off some of the basic "good commandments" for a good blog post in layout, for me it triggered some of the great ones. I love the authors passion for discarding conventional thinking and hitting hard at finding that underlying honesty that will enable you to ultimately find work you can love.

Another example is in [this one] (http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/currency/2014/02/the-powerlessness-of-positive-thinking.html) suggested by Arvi -  While the author does use a lot of data or analysis in support of his theory the overall belief that he exhibits in destroying this really popular notion of positive thinking is quite catching!

##3. Politeness does not make for great blogging. 

Finally, if you are writing on a topic that is potentially intriguing and supported with strong belief and passion - backing off or being polite has no place if you are looking to fire up your audience. Note that,  I strongly believe that any kind of bigotry has no place and am not promoting it. However, this should not be confused with calling a spade a spade. In your writeup, for example,  if you feel someone is not doing something right - but the said person is one of power or influence - either show some guts and say so OR find something else to write about. No point being polite if it goes against your own belief. A touch of cynical humor would add a nice dash of flavor in such cases.

I really like the way [this piece] (http://www.techradar.com/news/software/applications/the-10-most-hated-programs-of-all-time-1060129) of writing lays into each of the most hated software of all times they have identified. No holding back in this one. (Note - I like the post. Hate the overall website layout)

#In Short...
To Summarize, I believe there are a lot of good posts around. They follow some very good patterns in their structure that offers great readability and couple it with some really good information on a certain topic. The really great posts, however, are the ones that evoke certain strong responses in us. We either want to hug the writer or tear them apart. Both of these are founded on the strength of the intrigue and belief of the writer. 

They could end up being super successful in terms of reach, audience, engagement etc. But, to be honest, that to me is almost a secondary goal - you can't force yourself to feel all of the emotions above to create a great post. Rather the emotions help you create the post that ultimately may be successful.
