##Overview

Every once in a while, when you try out a product, you will first be unable to see how it could add value to you or how it is different from many other good, similar products in the space. When I looked up [Cloze](https://www.cloze.com/) a couple of weeks ago, one of their taglines about *outwit(ting) the noise* appealed to me. So I dutifully signed up with an email account, my primary Twitter account as well as my personal Facebook and LinkedIn accounts. I installed the iPad app and poked around a bit with its web and iPad versions. I liked the clean organization of the social dashboard, the messaging around prioritizing the important human elements of social interactions and the speed with which Cloze started identifying and picking up updates from people I regularly interacted with.

After that initial spin, I went back to my regular ways of checking my regular social feeds from the regular apps that I use for each. Then, one fine day, I remembered Cloze again. This time I wanted to explore it in detail and try to understand how it works and how it might be of value to me. I went and added my personal email account that I use to communicate personal stuff with close friends (while mildly questioning my recklessness in putting truly valuable private data in the hands of an algorithm) and also installed Cloze's pre-release beta version of the Android app on my Nexus 4. 

Suffice it to say that after giving Cloze a while to start picking up data, I began liking it very much. So, let's get started and look at this product *up Cloze*.


#Evolution 
For our Product Spotlight posts, with assistance from resources such as [archive.today](archive.today) and [screenshots.com](screenshots.com), we usually piece together the evolution of a product from a few screenshots. Do note this is not necessarily all changes and certainly not 100% reliable. However, it does provide some insights into the product and is generally useful information to have. Let us try tracing the evolution of Cloze's online presence:

<br/>

The earliest relevant screenshot of Cloze is from March 2012 where the messaging was around organizing the work life's email and the sorting of one's professional network. By September 2012 there were some successive messaging changes. 

<br/>

<figcaption>Cloze Webpage Screenshot A from September 2012</figcaption>
</figure>

One of the screenshots in early September 2012 shows that the focus is still on email but introduces the idea of identifying important connections and of filtering out the noise in social chatter. It also indicates some relationship management and recommendation features such as the ability to show the user who in her network has the best connections and can therefore make the best introductions.

In a couple of weeks from the earlier screenshot, there was a newer, more honed version of the Cloze website that called out its features, graduating to a prominent *signup* button from a *request invite* button. September 2012 seems like a clarifying, maturing point in the lifecycle of Cloze, as can be deduced from its web history.

By March 2013, Cloze had most of the visual features of its current webpage - the simple background of a person checking her iPad. Its messaging crystallized into *the inbox is human again*. In a few months, the messaging would be tweaked into *the social is human again* and Cloze would introduce its team sharing app [Circulate.it](https://circulate.it/) (which is also integrated into Cloze).

From its evolution, it appears that Cloze set out to solve the problem of organizing important contacts from email and helping users never miss the important conversations. Over time they seem to have extended the same metaphor to other social networks and conversations.

##Navigation and Usability 
Cloze has a feature-rich web dashboard as well as robust mobile apps that take advantage of gesture based productivity.

<br/>

</figure>

**Web:** At any point in time, only necessary elements for user interaction show up on the UI. Details are neatly collapsed behind lists and may be accessed when required. The menu sidebar on the left, when visible, has sections for **Scheduled** and **Saved** items as well as ones for **Mail** and **Social**. Under Mail or Social, updates are categorized by the importance of the person to the user. So each of these sections has ***Key People*** pulled into a separate list so that updates from them can be quickly accessed. The Social section also has a list of people the user may be ***Losing Touch*** with. This is an interesting and useful list that the user may use to revive some important associations.  A **Search bar** on top of the menu sidebar allows easy access to a specific contact. 

The right side of the page shows the detail of the update selected. Cloze could almost double up as a quick email client because, not only does it allow the user to read email (from various sources like Gmail. Yahoo, Exchange...), it also lets her respond to and archive them. For social networks too, conversations may be responded to or scheduled for other actions *in situ*. 

<br/>

  The Scheduled section holds social media updates that have been scheduled to go out at an optimal time (Cloze does auto-queuing based on the visibility times of the user's network). The Saved section holds items that have been bookmarked for later viewing.
  
**Mobile Apps**:  The apps use gestures for quick actions on items. Expected features like marking as read, archiving, saving for later may be accomplished by swipes, long presses or two finger prising and so on. The Android app, which is still in pre-release beta, read the contacts on my phone and tied them to the contacts Cloze had collected from my networks and integrated most of them quite well. It also offers the capability to edit a contact so that information may be corrected if necessary. 


##Functional Highlights 
In the previous section, while looking at Navigation and Usability, we covered the layout and sections in Cloze. **The key functionality of Cloze is to make communication from and insights into the user's important people easily accessible to the user**. Each contact in the user's list can be viewed in a contact details panel that opens out on the left (in the web version) when the contact image is clicked. The interesting thing about the contact details panel, other than the handy consolidation of phone and social network coordinates, is the ***Cloze Score***. This score offers insight into the quality of interaction the user has had with that contact.

##Conclusion

<figcaption>The Cloze Pledge</figcaption>
</figure>

Products that require deep levels of authorization of user accounts in order to provide maximum value have to tread the tricky territory of establishing trust and credibility and then working to sustain and grow that trust. As a user, I felt a little uncomfortable at opening up so much of my data to a single product. However, getting past that resistance is essential to see the usefulness of such a product. 

I've enjoyed using Cloze these few days and I intend to continue using it everyday while I figure out how it integrates into my activity flow. It seems like a very good hub to catch up on the important associations in my network. 

Recomended.
