There are just so many [wonderful tools](http://blog.justshareapp.com/10-best-startup-tools-for-social-media-marketing/) available to manage the execution of your social media strategy. It is also true that your social media budget will determine which of the many wonderful tools you can afford to use. 

So let's start simple. You are an individual looking to build your social presence OR you are a small business/company looking to build your brand. You are swimming in the ocean of choice and it can get really confusing really soon. You cannot get away from some must dos like:

* You MUST Explore what tools[^2] are available and how people are using them
* You MUST Identify and Define Your Social Media Needs
* You MUST Research Further
* You MUST Experiment

There are just so many wonderful *free* tools available to get you started on the execution of your social media strategy. Let us **take a look at 5 of them which can help you familiarize yourself with Social Media Listening**. Remember that attentive listening is the first step towards refining your engagement and building your influence. 

###Our Favourite Five
All the tools below are real-time search enablers. They are differentiated by their choice of networks to search for and their granularity in the display of fetched results.

###1: [Socialmention*](http://www.socialmention.com/)

*Social mention is a real time search platform*. It provides real-time search and analysis across various social media.

The biggest plus of *socialmention\** is that it searches across **many categories**. So there are blogs, microblogs, events, comments, video, images, audio and many more that it can search mentions for. It also shows you latest **trends** in mentions and offers **alerts** and **plugins** to automate your listening process.

The analytics offered by socialmention* are quite comprehensive:

* There is a **sentiment ratio** which quickly shows you what the positive to negative ratio is for your mention

* A **strength** percentage indicates the likelihood of you being mentioned in social media

* A **passion** percentage shows you what the engagement is likely to be

* A **reach** percentage tells you what your range of influence is

Socialmention* also shows you **Top Keywords**, **Top Hashtags**, **Top Users**, and **Top Sources**.


###2: [IceRocket](http://www.icerocket.com/)

IceRocket works like a search engine and it scans blogs, Twitter and Facebook to find results that match your search query.  

Like a typical search engine you can 

* search for multiple words
* search for specific phrases within quotes
* OR, AND and NOT possibilities and group them with parantheses
* include or exclude specific words with "+" or "-"

So let us say you wanted to look up "Social Media Listening Conference". [Here's what IceRocket might get you](http://www.icerocket.com/search?tab=buzz&fr=h&q=Social+Media+Listening+conference) from blogs, Twitter and Facebook at a given point in time.

Are you wondering why not use Google instead? Well, here, [try the same thing with Google](https://www.google.com/#q=social+media+listening+conference). 

So let us list some reasons why IceRocket isn't the same search as Google: 

a) It specifically looks at blogs, Twitter and Facebook for recent mentions of the items in your search query 

b) It offers a single page Search All that can look across blogs, Twitter and Facebook and fetches results for your search ordered by *most recently mentioned*
 
c) It catalogs a lot of blogs - how is 200+ million for a number? - and you can submit yours too. 


###3: [Social Searcher](http://www.social-searcher.com/)

Social Searcher is a Free Social Media Search Engine. 

*Wait a minute, isn't that what IceRocket is?* Yes! A couple of things are different here:

a) Social Searcher looks at the words you are searching for in **Twitter, Facebook and Google+**. 

b) They offer analytics across a variety of buckets: 

* **sentiment analysis** - positive, negative, neutral
* **user breakup** across networks - percentage of users across networks broken down further by popularity and activity who are connected with your keyword search
* **domains/links** that are popular among these results, broken down across the three networks monitored
* **post types** - video, photos, links, status updates
* **keywords** - listed with count
* **popular posts** connected with your listening from all three networks



###4: [Twazzup](http://www.twazzup.com/)

Twazzup is a Twitter specific tool. It provides *Real-Time Monitoring and Analytics for Twitter*. You can enter keywords, names, hashtags and set preference for language and get Twazzup to monitor the occurence of these items in **real time** on Twitter. It offers top keywords related to your search and shows the top influencers and most active tweeters from among the tweets. It also shows the top retweeted links and photos related to your search words.

Once you set it up with the words you are interested in and hit the *Monitor* button, Twazzup keeps running to check for these words. There is a handy play/pause button at the top of the results screen to let you pause the results stream from updating in case you want to drill down further on a certain set of results. 


###5: [Topsy](http://topsy.com/)
Topsy offers **Social Search**, **Social Analytics**, **Social Trends**. It has access to all tweets since 2006 and offers very granular level of analyzing tweets and influencers. While Topsy also has a Pro plan, the free version has enough to get you started in your Social Listening experiment.

Social Trends are always interesting to study and Topsy shows you the Top 100, 1,000, 5,000 and 20,000 across several languages and various types of shares including links, tweets, video and photos.


###Summing Up
Our choice of free tools above is heavily tilted towards Twitter. But, given the nature of that social network it does offer more data for these tools to study and offer analysis on. 
 
 
In attempting to filter only free tools with useful features for Social Media Listening, I tried a number of very robust tools. I particularly love [Keyhole](http://keyhole.co/), [Followerwonk](https://followerwonk.com/) and [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/wtf). Bear in mind that your first steps like the [Hootsuite dashboard](https://hootsuite.com/dashboard) or [Tweetdeck](https://tweetdeck.twitter.com/) offer powerful ways to listen to the Twitter streams. Likewise many integrated Social Media Management offerings have Social Listening baked into them and you can tweak them to suit your needs.
