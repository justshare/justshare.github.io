Meet [Robert Caruso](http://twitter.com/fondalo). CEO of [BundlePost](http://www.bundlepost.com), and ranked in [Forbes' Top 50 Social Marketing Talent](http://snip.ly/6sd/#http://forbes.com/sites/meghanbiro/2014/05/08/recognizing-the-worlds-top-40-social-marketing-talent/), he is one of the leading social media marketers around. 

Our discussion with Robert was serendipitous. Robert was mentioned in one of the [Daily Best](http://jshr.in/t0ps0c) roundups that we put out a few weeks back. When we tagged Robert in a tweet, he initially jibed that we were spamming him. But in just a bit, he offered to help - something that he described as "Social done right". I soon understood why Robert has a reputation for being helpful.

I caught up with Robert the next day over Skype to get his take on the state of social media, what he felt was working well, what Bundlepost does, and what he sees as some of the current challenges people face. 

## The Rules of Social Media Marketing

According to Robert, there's a few key tenets that all marketers needed to keep in mind. And leading with these fundamentals is essential for social success.

1. Everything starts with content
2. Content leads to conversations
3. Conversations build relationships
4. Relationships result in revenue and RoI

## Succeeding in Social Media


I then asked Robert about what he felt was working well in social media. His smile broadened, and his Italian eyes twinkled. He laid out a few things.

- Building a lot of followers. Both quality and quantity of followers matter.
- Sharing good content
- Sharing frequently
- Sharing consistently
- How you share matters

Robert drew an analogy between Twitter and freeways. It's like there's a freeway with lots of cars. Someone glances at the freeway twice or thrice a day. You want to make them see your car. How do you achieve that? By getting your cars on the road as frequently as you need to, and ensuring that your car is relevant to them.

## Bundlepost

[Bundlepost](http://www.bundlepost.com) is a homegrown tool that Robert's agency developed. They built it internally when they started to notice that they were spending 80% of their time managing their content and scheduling, and that took away from time they'd rather be spending with their clients. 

Bundlepost helps people curate content, set up a schedule, add hash tags, manage RSS feeds (they're building a large searchable index of feeds). Finally, you can export the schedule and posts into tools like HootSuite. They currently push out 2.5 million pieces of content every month. Robert is passionate about the tool (as he is with most things), and takes time out to walk newbies through the product and help them get going.

One of the things that Robert focused on early on, was ensuring he had paying users. In his opinion, the social media tools space is very crowded. There's a number of players who don't get social media, and build tools which get a number of free users, but don't convert into paying users. The real paying users are marketers, whose needs are different from the broader community.

## Current Challenges

In Robert's mind, two of the main challenges most social media marketers face today are

1. Finding their target users. Tools that exist today don't let marketers slice and dice the population in a consistent way across social networks. For instance, Twitter lets you analyze certain things like geography, but Facebook has certain restrictions that limit it.
2. Finding relevant engaging content for their target users. For marketers that are tweeting over 20 times a day, there's a lack of tools to help them find content that matters to their target audience.

It doesn't help that each social media tool has its limitations that make a lot of these harder. This adds to the manual effort marketers currently need to put in on a daily basis. We'll continue to collate findings on the challenges marketers face, and roll these up into a separate upcoming blog post.
