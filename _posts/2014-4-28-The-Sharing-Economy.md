Sharing is Caring [^1]

We ask the question [**Why do we Share?**](http://blog.justshareapp.com/Why-Do-We-Share/) We share because we are human. And because we are human and we like to share we do something about enabling it. **Sharing Economy** denotes all those endeavours that enable sustenance through sharing.

###What is a Sharing Economy?

Sustenance through collaboration [^2]

Sharing Economy has become a buzzword in the last few years and its scope has been growing. So what is a Sharing Economy?


Benita Matofska of [The People Who Share](http://www.thepeoplewhoshare.com/blog/what-is-the-sharing-economy/) defines it as

>The Sharing Economy is a socio-economic system built around the sharing of human and physical assets. It includes the shared creation, production, distribution, trade and consumption of goods and services by different people and organisations. - See more at [The People Who Share](http://www.thepeoplewhoshare.com/blog/what-is-the-sharing-economy/#sthash.SoMxAAEA.dpuf).


The key characteristic of a Sharing Economy is the direct involvement of individuals and the close connect between the provider and the user and the service being shared. Throughout history, Sharing Economies have been seen to evolve during times of economic crises.



###What do people share?

In the web space, each of us shares knowledge and information daily. We pick up interesting thoughts and ideas and pass them along. The ceaseless flow and [exposure to varied types of information](http://isites.harvard.edu/fs/docs/icb.topic472736.files/Zajonc.pdf) can expand thinking and outlook by making us familiar to a greater number of entities.


In the consumption and collaboration space, many people are waking up to the fact that resources are finite and excesses of purchase and consumption need to be addressed. We are, now more than ever before, caught in the stranglehold of the *planned and perceived obsolesence* of possessions and knowledge and thereby in the endless quest for better and different. Therefore conversion of skills and possessions as services is finding favour.


People share

* **Knowledge** - *Hey [StackExchange](http://stackexchange.com/about), what would we do without you!*

* **Services** - *Micro-participation including crowdsourced and crowdfunded projects have been hugely successful and must be considered as evolved forms of offering service*

* **Resources** - *Renting car rides, renting cars, sharing or renting home space - the most popular segment in the Sharing Economy given the success of Lyft, Uber, AirBnB and similar*


Some of the **benefits** are to

Spread the light[^3]

* **Reduce hyperconsumption**: the need to own everything that one might occasionally find use for

* **Repurpose excesses**: stuff whose use has been outgrown or stuff that only gets minimally used

* **Generate handy income**: effective use of knowledge or goods already in one's possession as income generating entities

* **Foster new human connections**: Make new friends through a purpose

The [success of Airbnb's home-sharing](http://articles.latimes.com/2014/apr/06/opinion/la-oe-rifkin-airbnb-20140406) is proof enough that people will be open to putting the unused to profitable use.


For a more expanded look at motives for sharing (practical, social, environmental, financial, curiousness), take a look at [Why are people taking part in collaborative consumption](http://www.collaborativeconsumption.com/2013/07/11/why-are-people-taking-part-in-collaborative-consumption/)


###Some Examples of a Sharing Economy as it is evolving

It would be too narrow to restrict a Sharing Economy to only one-on-one transactions that directly get two individuals connected. It is more about direct individual participation in the creation and use of ideas and resources. Using this broader definition, a [Sharing Economy 3.0](http://www.pinterest.com/startupyou/sharing-economy-30-crowdfunding-coworking-collabor/) version would include not just sharing of one's possessions or skills but also participatory contribution mechanisms such as crowdfunding, crowdsourcing, coworking and so on.


When **Kickstarter** launched in 2009, they were evoking the centuries old trend of offering patronage to artists and enabling it through a digital medium. To quote them from [Seven Things to Know About KickStarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/hello):

>"Since our launch in 2009, 6 million people have pledged $1 billion, funding 60,000 creative projects. Thousands of creative projects are raising funds on Kickstarter right now."


That's a wonderful indication of what technology can facilitate.

I first encountered the fascinating world of an Israeli [**Kibbutz**](https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Society_&_Culture/kibbutz.html) in Erich Segal's [Acts of Faith](http://www.amazon.in/Acts-Faith-Erich-Segal/dp/0553560700). The idea of a communal settlement with access to shared resources and emphasis on collaboration has a lot of merit and, like all good ideas, its time influences its form. [**Coliving**](http://coliving.org/), a natural progression from or a parallel evolution to [**Coworking**](http://coworking.org/), is [finding appeal in San Francisco](http://techcrunch.com/2014/04/21/tech-savvy-communes-could-be-the-answer-to-sfs-housing-issues/) as housing issues plague the residents:

>"These digital hippies mostly work in tech jobs writing code or in some capacity touching the SF tech scene. Their aim, they say, is to live with like-minded individuals in the next wave of the sharing economy. This is the difference between the communes of yore and today’s modern collective. Where communalists in the 60’s often eschewed outsiders and technology, these modern housemates embrace both."


###What's likely in store?

**Regulation**: Like the world of the Internet itself, the necessity and extent of regulation in a Sharing Economy will require discussions and recommendations. As the adoption grows, [Managing risks in the Shared Economy](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/ted-devine/the-6-risks-for-sharers-i_b_5186282.html) becomes essential. From starting out imagining themselves to be a [kind of event-specific craigslist](http://www.wired.com/2014/04/trust-in-the-share-economy/), AirBnB has needed to evolve to handle the [practical ramifications of trust](https://www.airbnb.com/trust). When there is rapid growth, can legal be far behind?


**Redefinition of Trust**: Trust will be huge. Will Facebook or Twitter be sufficient credibility determiners or will an all-seeing reputation tracker raise its head? [Jason Tanz](https://twitter.com/jasontanz) covers [Trust in a Sharing Economy](http://www.wired.com/2014/04/trust-in-the-share-economy/):

>...sharing-economy companies don’t have on-site managers and staffs. They’re a ragtag collection of loosely organized individuals. Their centralized trust infrastructures may catch obvious bad actors—purveyors of fake listings, money launderers, thieves—but they won’t stop more run-of-the-mill offenders like the driver who’s got a bit of a lead foot or the houseguest who carelessly drips candle wax all over your speaker. That requires more subtle forms of social engineering. RelayRides CEO Andre Haddad compares it to parenthood. “I have three kids,” he says. “You can’t control them, but you want to nudge them to do the right thing.


**Reputation Consciousness**: We will likely enter an age of acute reputation consciousness as our online footprint follows us around without an expiry date. Are we suitable people to engage with economically or socially will be determined by our trails. There may be trust level ratings, time bound suspensions from online transacting, perhaps even second chances to reestablish credibility.
