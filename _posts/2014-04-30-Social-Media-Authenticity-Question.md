How much of sociable do we need when it comes to marketing via social media? Can we escape the fact that `targeted interaction` or `purposeful engagement` cannot masquerade as general human connection?

##Brands as Humans

It is usefulness that is foremost and try to help or facilitate instead of being unnecessarily funny or trying to `engage` if you are a human behind a brand says [Tracey Parsons](https://twitter.com/tparsons) in [Stop Trying to Be Human - Try Being Useful](http://www.socialmediaexplorer.com/social-media-marketing/stop-trying-to-be-human-try-being-useful/):

>"The beauty of social vs. your website is that it is so bleeping easy to add content that will answer questions that your customers probably have that may be a barrier to purchase. Use social for this! Be helpful. Help them learn something they may not already know about your product, brand or company."

She says **don't** just look at your product but look at the category that your product represents and try offering tips and hacks to make them more **useful** for its users. Avoid fancy sales talk about your brand's virtues and instead `show them`.

### The Futility Of Appearing Human

Parsons says her post was inspired by [Jason Falls'](https://twitter.com/JasonFalls) [An Apology to Brands on Behalf of Social Media Experts Everywhere](http://www.socialmediaexplorer.com/social-media-marketing/an-apology-to-brands-on-behalf-of-social-media-experts-everywhere/). Falls looks at the **futility of brands attempting to be human** in the light of Facebook's policy changes in how it treats brand pages:

>"*When Facebook turns down the dial, preventing any brand page’s content from reaching it’s intended audience, fewer people will see it to begin with. **Fewer people will engage with it overall**. The same success will take driving people there and asking them to carry that content’s torch forward for you.
It’s not a question of whether the good brands can still be good. It’s that they are going to have to be 10 times better now to achieve the same success. And for them, that sucks.
**Brands are not people.** And we’ve been leading them to believe they are for a long time now. As brands begin to understand they can’t have the same type of organic success a human-as-brand consultant has, we need to also inform them that what used to be a great benchmark for engagement metrics, is now going to be next to impossible. Their outcomes will change. Their expectations need to change. Their investment may need to as well.*"

In a follow up post to the contentious one mentioned above, Falls [continues to argue](http://www.socialmediaexplorer.com/social-media-marketing/proof-brands-are-not-human/) that a person and a brand are two different things.

### What Humans Care About[^3]

[Andrew Hutchinson](https://twitter.com/adhutchinson) writes in [3 Notes on Being More Human and Building Your Brand in Social Media](http://socialmediatoday.com/adhutchinson/2255996/three-notes-being-more-human-and-building-your-brand-social-media):
>"Whilst more people are embracing creativity and experimentation, there are some things that we’ve learned that are universally true, some aspects that, regardless of the medium, will remain influential in success. Those elements are human factors. You can’t do business without people. **It's people who purchase your products, people who spread your brand message.** You can’t succeed in social media without understanding the importance of building and maintaining human relationships. Whilst social media is technology based, it’s people who drive it, and we don’t build relationships with avatars and user names alone."

Hutchinson says, "**Life in general is absorbing new methods of interaction as social media grows into our collective cognizance**", therefore we are all experimenting and learning ways of expanding reach and building strong communities.

####Pitstop

* Brands cannot mimic the online persona of an individual human being. They need to learn to carve their own online identity
* It makes sense for Brands to focus on how to be useful rather than on sounding human
* Brands are built and marketed by people to people and human factors are universal. What needs to be worked out is how to be both authentic and visible as a brand

##Humans as Brands

[Debbie Peck](https://twitter.com/debbiempeck) offers some insights that she gained late last year from her telesummit on Social Media for Social Impact. In [Social Media Authenticity - The Business of Being Human](http://crushmarketinggroup.com/social-media-authenticity-the-business-of-being-human/) she summarizes tips on how to remain human while presenting the personal self as a brand:

>"It’s not all about business. Social media authenticity is about making sure we are putting some of our own personalities out there. Sometimes we tend to get caught up in what we are doing and forget to let people know who we are. We don’t have to share our whole life story or tell everyone what we had for dinner, but letting people know the kinds of things we do in our spare time, or the fact that you are a parent allows people to resonate with you. **People do business with those that they know, like and trust.**"

### Personal Branding Tips

In the Guardian, at the beginning of 2014, marketing strategist [Dorie Clark](https://twitter.com/dorieclark) shared [personal branding tips](http://www.theguardian.com/media-network/media-network-blog/2014/jan/06/brand-you-2014-personal-branding-tips). One specific tip stood out:

>"**Seize on an emerging trend**: When you're first building a name for yourself, it's hard to be a generalist. If you want to become known as an expert in sports or politics, there's infinite competition. But if you pick an emerging trend, you often have a clear path forward.
As technology thought leader Robert Scoble told me in a recent interview: 'If you pick a single niche that isn't well covered – like Google Glass - and you have an authoritative blog, if Google Glass takes off, all of a sudden you're getting invited to press conferences and other events about wearable [technology]. It's a lot easier to get known as a person who covers a niche.' What's the emerging trend you can explore?"

Is this something that brands can also stretch themselves to explore and capitalize on?

####Pitstop

* Individuals need to pay attention to their online identity as much as they do to their real world or offline identity

* Individuals need to spend some time thinking about who they are, what their unique skills can be and how they can clearly build on showcasing those sets of skills while maintining their essential personality whether that is quirky or soft or funny.

***

### Takeaway Questions

Here are some **takeaway** questions

* Given budgets and increasing costs for social media marketing, is it better for a brand to focus on usefulness and value vs being perceived as sociable?

* Is it a huge mistake for brands to mimic being a person and for persons to think of themselves as being brands? Or are these two becoming indistinguishable?

* Is it time to stop differentiating online and offline behaviours and accept that the real world has multiple avenues and focus on core values to follow everywhere?
