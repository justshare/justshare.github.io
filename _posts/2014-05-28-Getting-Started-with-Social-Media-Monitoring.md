As a business, you cannot afford to ignore Social Media these days. Okay, that's an understatement. You cannot even afford to just “own and operate” a few social media accounts. You really need to have an active and aggressive social media strategy that involves monitoring, measuring, analyzing, engaging and leveraging your social accounts across multiple dimensions; marketing, support, customer satisfaction etc.

In this post, we wanted to share some of our perspectives as a business, as part of our learning journey in Harnessing the power of social media with a specific focus on Social Media Monitoring.

##Why Monitor?
If you want to progress your business goals via Social Media it is a given that you need to be doing some form of Social Media Monitoring. But it's important to layout “Why” you want to monitor. And the simple answer for us is that it *influences business outcomes - increases revenues, retains customers, directs your development/design/production efforts* etc.  This then leads to “What” you want to monitor and also to how you would like to react to the “what”.

Once you have figured out the “What” you need to figure out from “Whom”. So let's look at some of the potential candidates and some of the reasons you might want to monitor them for

- **Your customers**: These might be your current followers on Twitter or fans on Facebook.  You would want to monitor them to ensure the “Sentiment” is right, that you are able to retain and engage with them and to potentially improve your product/service.

- **Your potential customers**: These may or may not be your current followers or fans, so you will need to find them from various means - monitoring people tweeting with a particular hashtag, other facebook fan pages/groups etc. You might then be able to create targeted strategies to address them; understand their pain points, create the right language to relate to them, tailor your product/service to cater to them and so on.

- **Your competitors**: You could follow a similar method to following your competitors as your potential customers. These streams would be valuable in ensuring you are not behind in your product/service and also understanding their customers’ pain points to potentially target them. 

- **Your collaborators**: This is often ignored, but your collaborators - other vendors and partners are a crucial part of your success. Monitor them to understand where you can reduce friction and improve business value in your collaboration. 

Over a period of time, we found a good approach that helped us understand the structure, build our usecases and then finding the right tools to assist us. Which led us to the visualization of a Social Media Monitoring pyramid.


##Social Media Monitoring Pyramid
We talked about the  What, Why and Whom in the previous section.  The pyramid represents our experience of the corresponding stages of Social Media Monitoring.

###Social Networks
At the base are the various Social Media Networks and the various constructs they offer - Pages and Groups on Facebook. The feed, @mentions, Hashtags, Lists on Twitter. Pages and Groups on Google Plus. Pages and Groups on Linkedin and other elements from any other social networks of relevance for you.

These form the core data elements that we would usually like to Monitor. Now there are a few ways you could directly leverage Social Media networks but be prepared for a lot of gaps that will quickly and surely make you look for other tools on top of them. 

**Facebook**: Your basic news feed is nothing but a listening stream. However it has so much noise in it usually that it often defaults to just a casual pastime rather than something more rigorous. Having said that if there is just one Group or one Page you are interested in you could easily refer to them. If there are multiple, you could have a dedicated FB account to listen in just to them (no friends, just groups and pages!). You could look into the pages/groups insights for some reasonable amount of analysis data and Facebook has made some good recent additions such as the ability to watch and compare multiple pages.

It's harder for you to generally get a sense of just the most important posts unless you look through everything. 

**Twitter**:  Twitter is almost all about the stream. The ability to search via hashtags, mentions and other keywords does allow for some amount of filtering and makes it easier to listen in/monitor/consolidate. But there is very little direct analytics if any even compared to facebook. The good news though is with their open APIs from day one, there are a huge number of tools that are available to get you going.

Similarly do check out what other networks offer to get an understanding of the core capabilities.

Let's for a moment imagine how we would use the Social Networks for a typical usecase. We want to assess how important a certain feature is. We go and search for a number of people talking about it A. in Twitter, B. in Facebook.  We would probably have a number of browser windows open , switch between a bunch of tabs in our quest to figure out a pattern out of that. Unwieldy! And therefore we need the next layer  - Consolidated Listening.

###Consolidated Listening
Let's say from the above example, we have a dashboard of everything related to the area we are monitoring. Feeds from various source are brought together into one place. A look at this dashboard now allows us to have everything consolidated in one place. It allows us to feel the pulse in many ways - for example; the pace at which it is coming from or the source (and therefore its relative importance).

This in itself is actually very helpful. But it requires a dedicated person to monitor all activity and to be able to figure out when and how to act on what. Which brings us to the next step in this pyramid which we will get to shortly. 

An example of a good tool which provides some great consolidated listening capability is [SocialBuzz] (http://www.social-searcher.com/)  See an example dashboard below, you can easily configure a number of streams with specific keywords and other criteria to monitor.

HootSuite, Netvibes, SocialMention are some others that offer good listening capabilities.

###Intelligent Filtering
There are a number of factors that might warrant your attention to a stream or a specific element or post within a stream. You might want to know for example if a particular stream came from a person of “high influence” or from a specific Geography or with a particular Sentiment. 

Intelligence in Filtering such elements would play a significant role in your Social Media Monitoring strategy. The key is in understanding and finding the right tool to be able to highlight the relevant streams or posts in order to be able to react to them.

Here is a view of how you could see Sentiment based filtered posts in Social Buzz.

###Analytics
Do we need analytics? Yes we do, its a no brainer.  Or is it? So we find some good analytics tool and stare at the various pretty pictures presented to us. #that #is #not #ideal.

To support your social media monitoring efforts, try to take a stab at what you would like to analyze. With tools to provide you good Consolidated Listening with Intelligent Highlighting a lot of your “real-time” analysis needs are usually taken care of.  So is that enough? 

Not really. Monitoring (and reacting appropriately) is so involving, challenging and satisfying that you will end up straying from your larger goals. Make sure you know what you are looking for and measure it consistently, over a period of time, against factors that make sense. 

All of the tools mentioned previously do offer a decent amount of analytics. But here are a couple you could explore. Do note though that most tools require you to have a paid account to get more than basic analytics! 

[**HowSociable**](http://www.howsociable.com/) is a good analytics tool to measure the impact of yours or other brands. It does a great job of tracking multiple networks and provides a good degree of detail. On the flip side for popular networks such as Facebook and Twitter you will need to upgrade your account.

[**Fanpage Karma**](fanpagekarma.com) is another good analytics tool that offers good multi network support. You can review single fan pages or even side by side compare two pages. They have recently added some listening capabilities that look promising as well.

The idea of the pyramid above was to also facilitate a Top down approach - starting with the Why. However in real life usage you will likely start somewhere, with a tool and with data that is interesting at that point in time. No harm done, all we are advocating for and providing here is an additional approach that will help you with a larger picture that you should look at every now and then.


##Summary for Effective Monitoring
To summarize this rather lengthy post, keep in mind a few things

***
- Establish your goals
- Figure out “Why” you want to monitor “What” from “Whom” (and how you are planning to react to anything of interest from there)
- Set up your listening tools with a consolidated stream from the “Whom”.
- Setup intelligent filtering to highlight the “What” to you from the stream
- Setup analytics to assist you with realizing your “Why”. 
- Find a set of tools that assist you with your goals. Usually the listening tool offers an amount of intelligent filtering and some analytics. But you may require more than one tool to get everything you  need. Plus you may need additional tools for an additional level of analytics. 
- Make sure you are consistent with your monitoring. But continually tweak the Why/What/Whom as you learn. That will also help you with understanding your needs and searching for the best set of tools.
-  Finally, Read how other people do it, ask questions, share ideas. Nothing beats learning by doing!
