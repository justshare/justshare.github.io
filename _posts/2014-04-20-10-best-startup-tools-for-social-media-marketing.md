If you are a startup, or even a small enterprise with a limited marketing budget, you're likely looking to leverage social media in a big way as a part of your marketing strategy. Here's a round up of the best tools to help you share the love with your communities and followers.

Some of the key features you may be looking for are:

* Ability to post to multiple social networks.
* Ability to schedule your posts.
* Intelligent ability to schedule your posts when your audience is online.
* Analytics about your audience and engagement.


## #1. HootSuite

<figure>

<figcaption>Great for power users, but hard to use.</figcaption>
</figure>

The one with probably the largest number of users, [HootSuite](http://www.hootsuite.com) offers most of the above and more. Users however find the interface complex to understand and certain deficiencies in scheduling (for example allowing different schedules for different social profiles). However, those who get past the complexity seem to love this tool.  

## #2. Buffer

<figcaption>Simple, easy to use with multiple networks. Analytics are poor.</figcaption>
</figure>


Probably the most popular one out there as far as scheduling and related functionality are concerned. Also has a very popular blog. Users love the simplicity of the [Buffer](http://www.bufferapp.com), the various little things that make its scheduling software great including the integrations and browser extensions, as well as its customer orientation. While they do have decent analytics, users often cited them as weak relative to the others in addition to the limits on number of buffered posts in their free plan.

## #3. SproutSocial

<figcaption>Excellent HootSuite alternative, but their plans are more expensive.</figcaption>
</figure>


Like Hootsuite, [SproutSocial](http://www.sproutsocial.com) is an extensive tool that offers everything and more. Where it really shines is in its dashboards, analytics and the ability to group various social profiles. The paid plans are relatively expensive compared to the others (paid plans come with a 30 day free trial but there is no free plan) so this may not fit in with many startup or small enterprise needs - but is worth a mention if you are small social media agency for example.

## #4. PostPlanner

<figcaption>Great if Facebook is your primary audience.</figcaption>
</figure>


[PostPlanner](http://www.postplanner.com) has rich capabilities in creating various kinds of posts, but supports only Facebook posting. The interface is relatively complex as a result and some of the scheduling functionality is somewhat less obvious than the others.

## #5. PostCron

<figure>

<figcaption>Good interface especially for facebook posts. Free Plans have limits</figcaption>
</figure>


[PostCron](http://www.postcron.com) does an exceptional job of scheduling posts on various networks and even offer bulk upload capability that could come in really handy if you like to do some of your work in excel. Another unique feature is the ability to watermark images. However, they do not support networks outside of Twitter and Facebook (like linkedin as an example) and there are limits on the scheduled posts in their free plans.

## #6. Dlvr.it

<figcaption>Automagically schedule tweets from your feeds.</figcaption>
</figure>


Have a bunch of feeds and like to automatically share them on a schedule? [Dlvr.it](http://dlvr.it) does a great job of doing exactly that. However it differs from much of the others here in terms of amount of ability and ease of use if you wanted to create, schedule and share a bunch of customized posts that does not necessarily run off a feed.

## #7. Gremln

<figcaption>HootSuite minus the complexity. Free plans have limits.</figcaption>
</figure>


[Gremln](http://www.gremln.com) is gaining popularity as an alternate to Hootsuite, but is not quite at Hootsuite's scale. It still has some way to go before it hits the depth of functionality Hootsuite offers, but it is considered to be much easier to use. Also, unlike Hootsuite the free plans do have limits on scheduling posts.

## #8. 14Blocks

<figure>
<img src="http://d1hgw33z23fgm2.cloudfront.net/14blocks.gif"/>
<figcaption>Good scheduling analytics that helps you figure out when you should tweet.</figcaption>
</figure>


[14blocks](http://www.14blocks.com) is not as extensive or popular as some of the others in the list - but if you are looking primarily at twitter then their ability to analyze and schedule posts around the best time to tweet analysis is worth a look. Their pricing is very different to the others in that it is based on the number of followers - so a deeper cost benefit analysis is also worth doing.

## #9. Circular.io

<figure>

<figcaption>Free as in beer. DIY, open source scheduling tool.</figcaption>
</figure>


An open source, free software inspired by Buffer - [Circular.io](http://www.circular.io) supports the ability to schedule tweets only. It also doesnt have the bells and whistles (some of which you would find hard to get unused to!) of Buffer or the others. If you are looking for a free software and only interested in managing scheduled tweets to multiple twitter accounts this is one to consider.

## #10. Oktopost

<figure>
<img src="http://d1hgw33z23fgm2.cloudfront.net/oktopost.jpg"/>
<figcaption>Excellent for B2B marketing, especially for those focused on LinkedIn.</figcaption>
</figure>


[Oktopost](http://www.oktopost.com) has much of what all the other software in this list have, but are specialized for B2B marketing. While they support most social networks in most of the relevant usecases from above, their linkedin support is probably more extensive than anyone else'. Their paid plans seem to start a little higher than some of the others though.

## Summary

If you are startup, looking to establish a social media presence across a number of channels, but working with a tight budget, these are the tools for you. We have largely looked at the scheduling and related capabilities of these tools. However, note that some of the tools like HootSuite, SproutSocial and Gremln have significant social media monitoring and listening capabilities. These are indicative of ongoing convergence towards end to end "Social Media Management" suites by others as well over time.

If you are a startup with technical chops and looking at just Twitter for coverage, Circular.io is likely to be your best bet if you'd like to avoid running up $10-50 per month just for sharing posts online. If you get by on the free plans until you start hitting the limits, Buffer is easy to use, snappy, and dependable. However, if you do hit limits or need to manage a small team you will likely need to pickup one of their paid plans!
