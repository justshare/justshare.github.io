As a social media publisher you are always trying to get the maximum out of your content. You spend a bunch of time creating posts on various social media sites and get better at getting value out of it. However the lifetime of posts is often just a few hours or in the case of tweets even just a few minutes.

Here is where the concept of brand pages or social sites such as RebelMouse can help you. They help aggregate into attractive formats your social media activity and help you publish them. Now, as users come to see the latest updates, not only will they be able to see and engage with the latest but they may also see some of your older updates that are still relevant and engage. You are able to increase the lifetime of your posts drastically.

RebelMouse provides all of this and more. You can pretty much make this the front and center of your blog or website for example. We take a look at all of these in more detail in this week’s Product Spotlight.

##Evolution
With assistance from resources such as [archive.today](http://archive.today) and [screenshots.com](http://www.screenshots.com), we usually piece together the evolution from a few screenshots. Do note this is not necessarily all changes and certainly not a 100% reliable. However, it does provide some insight into the product and is generally useful information to have.

RebelMouse launched late 2011 with a [launchrock](http://launchrock.co/) site that allowed people to request invites via email. They were simply positioned as a Social Platform. By mid 2012, they launched into a beta version. Access was still by invite only with signups via Twitter or Facebook. They were positioned as “Your Social Page”.

By early 2013, RebelMouse were still in beta but opened out generally without requiring an invite. They added in signups via Instagram and GooglePlus as options as well.  By mid 2013, they tried a number of positioning changes including “The Better Way to Build Websites”, “Amplify your Online Presence” and “Let Your Content Roar”.  They were still in beta all through 2013.

By late 2013 they had moved out of Beta to general availability. They Added a whole bunch of social profiles such as LinkedIn as well as RSS feeds integration. Modified positioning to “Let your content roar.” Added Rebel Enterprise paid plans with "amplified features".

In early 2014 they evolved to the current site design with positioning as “Publishing Reimagined”. They also simplified login to via Email or FB, Google, Twitter.

*Disclaimer: The above is gathered from reviewing web archives. The timelines, changes and the reasons for change may be inaccurate and are only our attempt to guess the evolution of the product.*

##Navigation and Usability
You can get started by logging in with your facebook or twitter account or even via email. Once you have logged in you are prompted to provide a site name and your email ID/password. Feedback on availability of the site name is instantaneous. You can connect more networks optionally and your Brand Page is ready in a few seconds.

The speed with which RebelMouse creates your brand page at the beginning and also updates with changes is extremely quick and really impressive.

It is real easy to get started with a simple layout where your page takes the central view. You can start to rework on your site by clicking on just *view my site*. The settings button on the left overlaid on your site provides a number of options. But you can start by just clicking on the edit icon on the right side to add text or even upload an image or pull from an URL.

There is no guided tour unlike in many other products. Nor is there very easy help accessible at hand. This is a slight downside. But do note that it is only slightly so, since the interface is fairly easy to use and highly performant as well.

##Functional Highlights
Once you are done with the setup, your initial page is ready. Your initial rebel page is automatically created with posts from your connected account. You also have auto-created tabs for various commonly used hashtags and posts organized under that as well. Rebel also gives priority to picture posts so interesting ones show up higher, but all this can be configured and rewired later.

***Sections***: This is where you manage the tabs or sections on your site. By default rebel mouse finds the most common tags form your posts and configures your initial site with these sections. You can then manage them from here. You also have the ability to see your most popular tags and add sections from them as well.

***Content Sources***: This option provides rules on how to handle the core data and is quite flexible. From all of your social profiles you have many options. You can choose to automatically publish or save to drafts (and as described earlier, publish selectively from drafts). You can choose to publish only tweets or retweets and with or without media. You can filter them further by handle or hashtags or domain name etc. You can also add in streams from generic Twitter or Facebook hashtag, handle or other search terms with the same rules. 

It is also pertinent to note that RebelMouse supports multiple social media apps including Twitter, Facebook , Google Plus, Instagram, LinkedIn, Flickr, YouTube, Tumblr, Pinterest, Stocktwits and Giphy. You can also configure RSS feeds as well. Super Powerful!

You can also create your own custom theme as well making it really useful especially if you want to configure the page as part of your domain or even embed it.

##Conclusion
There is a lot to like and very little to dislike about RebelMouse! For starters the site is very quick. No endless waits on spinners. You have a number of sources you can pull data from and a good set of rules to draft or publish them. For non-technical users it is easy to choose from set of design options and easily style your site.  For technical users, you can easily customize the site further.

The free version has a lot to offer and if the RebelMouse branding elements on your site are not a deal-breaker, it is very usable. While we do not know how it is priced, the Rebel Roar plan looks to be a good option for those willing to put in some money for the additional value it offers.
