Following up on our last week's [Product Spotlight - Graphic Design for Social Media and Blogs with Canva](http://blog.justshareapp.com/Canva/), this week we look at an established and valuable product - [SocialBro](http://www.socialbro.com/).

SocialBro is Twitter-centric and offers data and insight for enabling *Twitter for business*es. 

##Evolution
With assistance from resources such as [archive.today](http://archive.today/) and [screenshots.com](http://www.screenshots.com/) we usually piece together the evolution of a product from a few screenshots. Do note this is not necessarily all changes and certainly not 100% reliable. However, it does provide some insights into the product and is generally useful information to have.

SocialBro has been around for close to four years. The earliest screenshot we could locate is from December 2011. At that point SocialBro's messaging was 'Manage and Analyze Your Twitter Community'.

By August 2012, the messaging had broadened and moved to its tagline as 'Explore Your Community'. SocialBro had also gotten significant media coverage from powerhouses like TechCrunch, Mashable, HubSpot, Social Media Examiner to name a few.

A year later, by August 2013, their messaging had crystallized to 'Enabling Twitter for Business' - which is a pretty good summing up of what their product does.

The current version of the SocialBro website calls out that it is 'The #1 marketing platform for Twitter'. Given its feature set, this seems entirely believable. 


##Navigation and Usability
The SocialBro Dashboard packs in a lot of dropdowns without overwhelming a user. The header on the dashboard calls out specific types of operations that you might want to do with your twitter account. Each operation then opens out into more detailed options for you to choose from.

For example, if you wanted to look at Analytics, SocialBro would offer you, once you chose the Analytics dropdown, many types of Analytics information options to choose from. Maybe you want to look at some insights about the community that follows you. SocialBro offers a great level of detail - you can look at demographics, gender data, frequency of nature of twitter activity of your followers and their level of influence and so on. 

The design of the dashboard works efficiently to provide many features in a well-guided flow. In our exploration of the product, we never found ourselves confused about what to do. 

##Functional Highlights
SocialBro is a [Twitter Certified Product](https://business.twitter.com/partners/list/certified-products). It is rich in features and can offer tremendous insight into your twitter account and your twitter audience.

* ***The Best Time to Tweet*** - Based on the activity and presence of your audience, SocialBro recommends the best times for you to schedule your tweets

* ***Analyze Your Competitors*** - You can provide specific twitter accounts to analyze. You can then benchmark yourself against them

* ***Twitter DM Campaigns*** - Tailor specific DM campaigns for certain followers for maximum impact. A very useful but delicate feature. *Think through why you may want to use this before you do. DMs may be intrusive if used indiscriminately*

* ***Benchmark*** - Measure yourself against market standards, your competitors, your own growth track

* ***CRM (Notes and Tags)*** - You can use notes and tags to categorize your audience and design custom ways to address categories

* ***Discover Twitter Users*** - See which new users will be valuable for you to connect with. SocialBro makes suggestions based on your account profile as well as widely influential people in its database that you must not miss

**Reports:** SocialBro provides many custom report options in addition to providing a very comprehensive report that offers stats and breakup across various parameters that it tracks.


The depth and breadth of information is incredible and it might make sense for you to explore at least their [Basic or Pro plans](https://buy.socialbro.com) so that you can have your tweets themselves analyzed. All their plans have 15-day trials. The best part is that **they also have a Free Forever plan** which you can use to quickly follow some stats like best times to tweet, follower/unfollower numbers and some handy community insights.
