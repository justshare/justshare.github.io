While there are many products that help you with social media management, monitoring and publishing, there are just a few that provide automation. IFTTT being one of the most popular among them. We review another option from an upcoming startup, [Jooicer](https://jooicer.com/) in this blog post.

Jooicer claims to help you “Build and Implement your own #GrowthHacking Strategies and jooice your account !!”. Sounded intriguing and we decided to take a peek and see what it does.  Do note that Jooicer is still in beta and is just a few months old.

Primarily **what Jooicer does is to help you automate your twitter tasks**. These tasks or “Recipes” can be based on certain criteria and end up with certain actions such as tweeting Or even just provide you with analysis to help you act appropriately.  Whats great is that they even have some great recipes shared across users that you can access and use! 

We take a look at all of these in more detail in this week’s Product Spotlight.

##Evolution
With assistance from resources such as [archive.today](http://archive.today) and [screenshots.com](http://www.screenshots.com), we usually piece together the evolution from a few screenshots. Do note this is not necessarily all changes and certainly not a 100% reliable. However, it does provide some insight into the product and is generally useful information to have.

Unlike many of the products we have reviewed in the past, Jooicer’s story is relatively new. The earliest available web captures show Jooicer in private beta invite mode state as recent as May this year (2014). By June 2014 they had launched their Beta software, allowing users to login via Twitter.

Disclaimer: The above is gathered from reviewing web archives. The timelines, changes and the reasons for change may be inaccurate and are only our attempt to guess the evolution of the product.

##Navigation and Usability
You can get started by logging in with your twitter account. Once you have logged in you are prompted to provide your email ID and are then taken to an interesting but busy looking Jooicer Dashboard.

There is no animated quick start guide like in many of the other products to get you started, but it's easy enough to browse your way around to figure things out. There is a quick tip on top to get started by discovering ready to use recipes.

You can manage everything related to recipes for your account on the left side menu on the dashboard. You can manage your account and profile details via menu items located on the top right. It is simple enough to access and browse around. Overall the layout is easy enough, but it is in the detailed interactions where the user may need more assistance. For example, a little more help on creating recipes would have been good. 

Some of the UI and Interaction details could also do with some improvement. For example, on creating a recipe, there was an icon showing “in progress” next to it. I did not notice that once completed, it would show a report icon under the report column that you would need to click to view the report (the in progress icon continued to show, therefore throwing me off in thinking it was not yet ready even after a day). It would have been nice to just click on the row and see the report directly.

Still, Jooicer is in Beta and we expect some of these will get tidied up by the time they are generally available.

##Functional Highlights
Once you have signed in, on the Dashboard, you get to see a quick view of some of the key statistics for your account such as Followers, Reach (total of your followers plus the followers of those who have retweeted you), engagement (attentions plus percentage retweets per follower). You can quickly access your recipes or create new ones from here.

What is a recipe and how does it work? The easiest way to figure this out is not so much to try and create a new recipe first up, but either go to my recipes to see some standard ones added OR better still to hit the big red button on the top center to “Discover - Ready to use recipes”.

Ready to use recipes is one of the most exciting features of Jooicer. Users can create recipes and share them (post approval by Jooicer) with other users. There are currently a dozen such recipes under this, including analytics such as “users who follow me and I am not following”, as well as actions such as “Automatically favorite tweets based on Keywords”.

Simply click on "+use recipe" to add a recipe to your account, specify your settings (e.g. specify the keywords you want to track in the case of the recipe shown below) and click create recipe. The recipe will be added to the list in your dashboard.

You can create your own recipes either from the Dashboard or by using the Create Recipe menu.  Start by providing a name, description and a desired action. *Do note that there is absolutely no help in sight and this can be quite daunting to start with.  But we do have a quick guide for you through the screenshots below!*

Next you select your filters. These are predefined lists of data that can be layered on each other so that you can retrieve a very specific list of users or tweets and further refine them until you have the report you desire. You can even suggest or request for a new filter right from there!

Below are screenshots from a filter we created to fetch data for “All Followers who Responded” as defined by followers that @mentioned our twitter account.

Note that the recipes could take several hours to fetch data, so you may have to wait a bit once you have created or added recipe to get back the results. Once done, you should see a Report icon next to the recipe in the Dashboard.

The other options on the Dashboard include: 

*My Recipes*:  By default you will see 3 recipes for Followers, Following and Tweets. There is a Type, Create Time, Status and Actions. Presumably these 3 are used to populate the quick view of stats in your dashboard. Once you create new ones or add from existing ones shared by others you should be able to see them here. 

*Scheduling*: It is not clear what can be done from here, but it seems to list the recipes scheduled. 

*Data Lists*: At this time this seems to be work in progress. From the indicative text on the website, this seems to be a powerful feature which allows you to create internal lists (based on users, tweets, keywords, schedules.). You can then use these data lists with your recipe filters to exclude or include items from your results. 

*Account/Profile*: You can click on Multi Account to add another twitter account or change to another added twitter account. If you have a team that works on the same set of accounts, you can also add another twitter user to access your  account via their jooicer login.

Another neat item in the Jooicer home page is their live roadmap view.  This has their roadmap with timelines and votes. You can even vote up to speed up development of certain features.

##IFTTT versus Jooicer
Many of you may be familiar with IFTTT and might be curious to know how Jooicer differentiates from them. A simple way to look at this is that IFTTT has much broader coverage whereas Jooicer has much deeper coverage.

IFTTT provides you triggers and actions for a very large number of applications whereas Jooicer at this point is just Twitter focused. However, even in its Beta form, you can do much more with Jooicer for Twitter than you can for IFTTT with Twitter and therein lies the differentiation.

##Conclusion
As a Twitter Marketer, you can use Jooicer for a number of interesting actions, both to improve engagement and to get analysis. We specifically found the potential for analysis to be tremendous, and this will only get better as more filters are added and more Recipes from other users become available.

There are a few usability and interaction items that can be improved upon, but for a Beta version Jooicer certainly rocks!
