Out of the blue, popular India movie star Rajnikanth joined Twitter. But things quickly went wrong and there was a strong follower backlash. Here's what we can learn from what happened.

## The Viral Super Star
For those who aren't aware of who Rajnikanth is, here are a few stats

* Popularly known as "Thalaiva", he is the most popular actor in the subcontinent, with each of his movie releases raking in millions. He was paid ₹450 million for one of his films, Enthiran.
* The launch of 'Kolaveri di', a music video went viral within days of launch, apparently largely due to the huge fan Rajni groups. On YouTube, the video has seen 79,997,869 views.
* For every Chuck Norris joke that's out there, there's a bunch of Rajni jokes doing the rounds.


Literally within minutes of his joining Twitter, and posting a *single tweet*, his follower count spiked to over 10,000. Now, that didn't surprise us one bit. Surely, it was only a matter of time before we would see the Twitter whale bubble up.

## When Things Went Wrong

But then, a few strange things started to happen.

The Rajni twitter account started to auto respond to the followers, asking them to check out an 'exclusive' movie poster. Quite literally, the tweet said: "here’s an exclusive Kochadian poster for you".

So, here's what was really happening. Fluence, the social media marketing company that handles a number of Bollywood celebrity accounts was managing the Rajni twitter account, and running a promotional campaign. The campaign was timed well with the launch of his new 3D motion capture movie, Kochadaiiyaan. But, by auto tweeting and spamming their followers, they violated the trust of his fans and left quite a few fairly pissed off.

## Lessons for social media marketing agencies

## Be human

[Sallu Bhai](https://twitter.com/BeingSalmanKhan) must be smiling. We've written extensively about the importance of striking a balance between [being human and being useful](http://blog.justshareapp.com/Social-Media-Authenticity-Question/) on social media. You can’t do business without people. It’s people who purchase your products, people who spread your brand message. Let's face it, no one wants to deal with a bot at the other end of the line. There's the story of someone who tweeted in an emergency saying he was near a bank's ATM, and got an auto bot response from the bank asking how they could help him!

## Authenticity

One of the reasons Rajni is revered is his authenticity. He keeps his off screen persona separate from his glamorized and over the top on screen image. It's a shame that Fluence didn't respect this while launching this campaign on Twitter. There's no substitute for authenticity.

## No spam, please

Our recent popular [Daily Best](http://jshr.in/t0ps0c) covered the issues of [spam in social media marketing](http://www.steamfeed.com/social-media-spam-spam/). It's important to *engage* your audience on Twitter, not just broadcast spammy links to them in order to promote things.

All this said, we wish Fluence the best, and hope the rest of the Kochadaiiyaan campaign is a huge success.

<b>The Lighter Side</b>

<b>Q</b>: What's the name of the auto bot that Fluence used for their social media marketing?
<br>
<b>A</b>: Enthiran (Robot), of course!
