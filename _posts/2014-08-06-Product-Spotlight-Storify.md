##Overview

Following up on our [Product Spotlight - Graphic Design for Social Media/Blogs with Canva]( http://blog.justshareapp.com/Canva/) we look at another product that in a different way provides you with the capability to create, share and benefit from viral social content - Storify.

As we continue to review the various social media related products out there, one thing is very apparent – there is a class of products that focus largely on helping you generate great content to amplify the effect of your social media publishing efforts. Storify is one of these.

Storify helps creates stories from content available from a number of social media and online sources. It pulls together search, editing and publishing capabilities in a simple and effective interface.  We take a look at all of these in more detail in this week’s Product Spotlight.

##Evolution
With assistance from resources such as [archive.today](http://archive.today) and [screenshots.com](http://www.screenshots.com), we usually piece together the evolution from a few screenshots. Do note this is not necessarily all changes and certainly not a 100% reliable. However, it does provide some insight into the product and is generally useful information to have.

Relative to many of the products we have reviewed so far there are two things that are apparent: Storify has some of the largest captures of screenshots from some of the above software and yet Storify has been relatively stable in their positioning for a longer period of time than some of the others.  This could potentially attest to their finding the right product positioning and product fit quite early?

During mid to late 2010, Storify launched with an invite based Beta program, positioned as the future of publishing. The website evolved pretty quickly from Jun to Oct in this period. By the end of 2010 they already had early users from the who’s who of online and offline news/media trying them out per their website.

By mid 2011, they had moved to generally available status allowing any user to login for free via Twitter.  Generally their positioning has stayed around Social Media Stories with some variations as can be seen below over this period of time.  

Since 2013, Storify’s positioning around “Make the web tell a story” has stayed consistent, as has the landing page, although a bunch of additional features have perhaps gone in once you sign up.

Disclaimer: The above is gathered from reviewing web archives. The timelines, changes and the reasons for change may be inaccurate and are only our attempt to guess the evolution of the product.

##Navigation and Usability
You can get started by logging in with your twitter or facebook IDs. The login process is a little unusual in that the entire validation seems to happen after you click signup, enter in a few details as also a captcha. (Most products out there quickly take you through the facebook/twitter auth first before prompting for any further information, usually optionally).  Once logged in, you are prompted to find friends you can follow.

Once you have logged in, getting started is fairly quick and as simple as the 1/2/3 steps promised on the landing page.  While there is no live animated flow to guide you as is often found these days in some of the other products, their tips to get started work fairly well.

Once you have logged in you can start to create your first Story. Everything you need from the ability to search a number of sources to designing and editing your story is all right there and very easy to use. You can flip back to a dashboard to see all your stories and edit/share them subsequently as well. We will explore more of these in the functional highlights section below.  Overall, while the feel of the site is not spectacular, it is all very well laid out, easy to use and performs fast as well.

##Functional Highlights
You can start creating a story. Storify has a large collection of options to search and select elements of your story from.  You can search for links, posts and comments from Storify itself or the 22 social media and web sources it currently supports including Twitter, Facebook, Google Plus, YouTube, Google Search, Flickr, Instagram, Getty Images, Giphy, SoundClound etc.! The search function works great too.

Storify also allows you to easily add specific images or links or text into your private collections as you browse the web. This is done through their browser extension (more on this a little later). You can then use these while creating stories at any time.

Creating a story is very easy with the ability to easily drag and drop items into your storyboard. You can easily rearrange and edit text within and around these items. A number of formats including photos, videos, text and links can be easily embedded. 

The interface is super easy and intuitive to use. Click anywhere in-between and you can start to add text.  Various formatting options include the usual bold/italic/underline/strikethrough. There is no option to change fonts/colors etc. though.  Also we wish there was a way to resize pictures/images as well!

Once you have your story created and ready to roll, you can save and/or publish the story by clicking on a button that says “Unpublish” – a little weird to be honest since the story wasn’t yet published at that point. You can view and tweak the publish URL

On successful publishing you can view the published story as well as share it to your social profiles via Twitter, Facebook or Google+. You can also get an embed code to embed this story in your blog or website.

You can go to your profile to view, edit or publish all your stories. (Note: the one marking "Getting started" below is a generic one that showed up even though I didn't author it :-). Clicking on it had my name as the author, so you get a story for free I guess! You can take a guided tour from here at anytime should you want a refresher on using Storify, although its unlikely you will need it considering how easy it is to use.

Storify also has a very neat browser extension and bookmarklet that are very useful in creating stories or just gathering elements into your private collections for use later.  These are available under the "tools" section (scroll to the bottom from any of your pages). While the location is not very visible, do note that these have been recently added.

While the bookmarklet allows you to capture any page you are visiting to a Story or a Collection, the chrome extension allows you to save any image, text selection or post as well.

##Pricing
Storify is free to use , but it does have a VIP version that is probably suitable for large media organizations, publishers and potentially larger enterprises with higher media budgets.

The VIP version appears to offer enterprise level additional features – real-time updates, customizable story embeds to align to your site, additional custom sources to search and build your story from, ability to create private stories, ability to export to PDF, additional aids for SEO, ability to collaborate via teams of writers, google analytics integration and Enterprise grade customer support.

The pricing appears to be enterprise level i.e. priced to requirement/deal by deal basis.

##Conclusion
If you are looking to charge up the content you create whether it is for your blog or a Social Media campaign or even for your website – you should check out Storify. All of the elements you require are available, work great and are easy to use. 

On the flip side, there are limited formatting options in your story example an ability to change the font. But having said that, it should not be too much of a bother generally unless you have specific branding guidelines for example that you would want to adhere to!
