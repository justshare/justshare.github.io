###What is a Burnout?

*A Burnout occurs when a system does not have enough fuel to function at optimum capacity*. 


The human system with its complex physical, mental, emotional and spiritual sub-systems is very susceptible to burnout especially in the fast paced era that we currently live in. 


The psychologist/psychiatrist **Herbert Freudenberger**, who did pioneering work on Burnout named it thus using a colloquial term then active for effects of chronic drug abuse.

In April 2007, Arianna Huffington collapsed in her office out of sheer exhaustion and sustained injuries in the head and face. This experience and its aftermath caused her to question what success means. She started asking what it means to live a good life and developed a third metric to success which she explains in her recently published book [THRIVE](http://www.amazon.com/Thrive-Redefining-Success-Creating-Well-Being/dp/0804140847) based on her experience of burning out and recovering from it. The title of this post, *Thrive, Don't Burn Out*, is a nod to Arianna Huffington's book. 


###How to identify a Burnout?

Burnout does not happen in one fell swoop. Instead there are many signs along the way that many of us choose to ignore because they seem minor enough to. 

A couple of weeks ago I came across this piece in [99U](http://99u.com/) on [The 12 Stages of Burnout](http://99u.com/workbook/25941/the-12-stages-of-burnout) based on Freudenberger's work. I sat with it for a while, reading and rereading. It reminded me of an eclipse.

A number of these stages seemed not just relevant to me but also personal: *Yes, I was there*, I thought. *Yes, I might be here now*, I nodded. The stages are so common and some of them are so much a part of what we define as the steps to being successful that we might very easily overlook what is becoming of ourselves in the process. 


I am going to go out on a limb and say that it is very hard to not be at some stage in the burnout process. Unless you have been very aware of what you are doing and have been balanced about your life needs, you are going to be nodding at one or more stages listed above and saying to yourself, *oh yeah, that's me alright*.


Let us run through the list of the **12 Stages of Burnout** (both the [99U piece on the 12 Stages of burnout](http://99u.com/workbook/25941/the-12-stages-of-burnout) and Ayers-Deets' piece on [How to Bounce Back after Burning Out](https://medium.com/@missafayres/how-to-bounce-back-after-burning-out-e3c6cffa18dc) quote from the stages listed in a 2006 Scientific American article [Burned Out](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/burned-out/) (paid access only)

***

* 1: Compulsive Need to Prove Oneself
* 2: Pushing Oneself to Work Harder
* 3: Neglecting Personal Needs
* 4: Displacement of Conflict 
* 5: Revision of Value System
* 6: Denial of Problems
* 7: Withdrawal From Society
* 8: Noticeable Behavioral Changes
* 9: Loss of Contact with Self
* 10: Inner Emptiness
* 11: Depression
* 12: Burnout Syndrome

Does any stage sound familiar? 


###How to bounce back from a Burnout?

There is no simple way to bounce back of course. It is a slow path to regaining your energy and enthusiasm for life. Andrea Ayres-Deets' [brilliant and very insightful piece](https://medium.com/who-what-why/e3c6cffa18dc) on her own burnout and recovery process is a must read. She details some recovery mechanisms which are valuable enough to paraphrase here:

* **Write down everything that causes you stress**. Nothing is trivial. If it bothers you then write it down. It could even be a pesky neighbour you have to navigate everyday. Andrea suggests writing small steps to handling each stressor alongside listing it. Take each stressor and figure out what you can start doing to minimise its effects on you. List the actions you could take and then start acting on them.  

* **Ask for help**. For most of us this is very difficult to do because it means admitting inability and weakness. Once we have identified stressors it will become evident which ones we need help with. Asking for help with specific things that overwhelm us is the first step towards overcoming them. People are usually willing to help if they know what we need help with. 

* **Sleep more**. Too simple right? But study after study has found that sleep is the magic medicine to a number of modern ills that plague us. Arianna Huffington, in her many promotions for the book Thrive, kept repeating that sleeping more is the best tool to staying sane and energetic. If you are trying to add more hours to your working day by cutting down on your sleep, STOP. 

* **Relax**. Find time regularly to do things that you enjoy. Our interests are what recharges us. Nothing time is not wasted time. As Sandberg and Huffington discuss in [this conversation](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KyV9KF-y1w), we are very mindful on the battery levels on our smartphone and constantly figuring out creative ways to factor in phone recharge time. If only we extended that same awareness to our own energy levels!


###How to protect oneself from a Burnout?

The steps listed in recovery, when practised regularly, are themselves preventers of burnout. But let us look at some simple practices that can keep our energy levels balanced even if we aren't resonating with any stage of the Burnout yet:

***

* **Start the day at a comfortable pace**. If you want your day to be calm and want yourself to not feel rushed then wake up earlier than you think you need to and spend several minutes simply sitting and quietly reflecting. 

* **Eat at Regular Intervals**. No starving and no stuffing yourself. 

* **Make Exercise a part of the day**. Something as simple as frequently walking counts.

* **Factor in Breaks at Work**. Plan your day so that you can catch your breath often.

* **Write Only the Unmissable Tasks in your To Do List for the day**. Don't make it an overwhelming list!

* **Make time for Fun**. Not when you *have* the time. You *make* the time

* **Say No to things that don't matter**. There are plenty of things you can say no to that you probably feel obliged to say yes to. Start saying No more often. 

* **Sleep and wake up around the same times everyday**. Prime the body clock. The body will respond to it.
