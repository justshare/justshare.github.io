##Overview

Edgar is new. He wants us to meet him (err, wait, we need to be invited to meet him) and he claims that he never lets our social media content go to waste.

Let us test his claim, shall we?


#Evolution
For our Product Spotlight posts, with assistance from resources such as [archive.today](http://www.archive.today) and [screenshots.com](http://www.screenshots.com), we usually piece together the evolution of a product from a few screenshots. Since Edgar is very new, there is no archival history yet. The current avatar seems to be his first.

Edgar's website says that social media marketers have to update more and more frequently in order to stay engaged with their users given that the life of a social media update is very short. Is there a better way to manage this? Edgar says *yes indeed*.


##Navigation and Usability
Edgar has a clean design with major features all grouped at the top. Each of the feature sections has its own page with well-defined indicators of functionality.

One of the things I liked is the help callouts that guide you along for every element that you can use. Each callout clearly tells you what a feature element is for and how you might use it. Once you are sufficiently familiar with the features you can do away with the callouts by using the 'end tour' button.


##Functional Highlights
Edgar is a content scheduling and publishing platform. He works with Twitter, Facebook - personal, pages, groups and LinkedIn.

He offers the standard features that one has come to expect from social scheduling and publishing platforms namely composition space for social media posts, manual and auto scheduling of posts, editing and reordering posts, posting to multiple social accounts and the like.

Edgar attempts to distinguish himself through a couple of features: **Categories** and **automatic reposting of old posts** (which don't vanish but sit in the library instead). Categories are the means by which you can group social media updates into custom schedules. Edgar offers you some stock categories and encourages you to add your own. Stock Categories include Inspirational/Funny, My Blog Posts, Promotional, Questions, Tips and Use Once. By default categories are built such that all posts in it get repurposed once the content queue is emptied of fresh content. Use Once is the category to use to tell Edgar that a social media update must not be repurposed and that it is meant to be used only once.

Edgar's scheduling is based on category and offers many options. It is possible to combine manual time slots along with Edgar's auto scheduling. There's a handy 'Random' Category that can be chosen in the scheduling that Edgar will use to repurpose posts across categories.

**Pricing** 
Edgar is pricey. The Individual Plan starts at $49/mo. for 10 social media accounts. The Business Plan is at $449/mo. for only 25 social media accounts and the Agency Plan is at $999/mo. for 100 social media accounts. Somehow the social media account cap seems limiting for the demanded price point.


##Conclusion
Edgar is still invite only and his analytics offering is still being built. These are early days for Edgar and he is quite charming and resourceful already. It will be interesting to see how he shapes up in the future.
